  "Description": " The 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering June 27, 2020 – July 19, 2020  \n \nVirtual ICSE is coming soon! \nThe main conference will be held starting on July 7th UTC time (July 6th in Europe and the Americas) and running for five days! Sessions have been organized into three timebands named by three major oceans: Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic. This means that everyone in the world will be able to participate in at least two timebands! (Those interested in a detailed explanation of this can find one here.) You can view the schedule on these web pages. All times are listed in UTC; however, you can customize the schedule to your own timezone by clicking on the word “change” under the complete schedule next to the header of the first day! \nWhat will Virtual ICSE be like? \nFirst of all, there will be keynotes and paper presentations organized into sessions and live-streamed onto YouTube (and mirrored on iQIYI). They will be available in our ICSE 2020 channel and you can view these even without registering. However, attending a conference involves far more than listening to talks. It is all about informal networking during coffee breaks, building new research collaborations, and getting to meet that researcher whose papers you have read. We’ve had a huge team of people working tirelessly to bring all of this together to create a new type of valuable and interactive experience for all ICSE attendees. \nWhy should you register? \nRegistered attendees will be able to: \n \n Initiate, or participate in, pop-up video discussions in private rooms during and after the talks. \n Attend technical briefings on cutting-edge Software Engineering topics. \n Network informally with experts at “Ask me anything” sessions and ‘birds of a feather” sessions. These will all be hosted in the third hour of each time band. If you have an idea for a session – let the PC Chairs know! \n Ask questions during talks and hang around after the session to chat with the presenters. \n Interact with demo and poster presenters \n \nWe have tried to keep registration fees as low as possible; however, there are some expenses that we’ve already incurred due to cancelling our physical conference. More importantly, there are new expenses involved in making Virtual ICSE far more than just a series of talks. \nCome and Join us! \nWe hope that you agree with us, and will join with us in making Virtual ICSE 2020 a memorable and valuable event. \nPlease register at: https://2020.icse-conferences.org/attending/registration \n \nACM-W Scholarship for Attendance at Research Conferences provides support for women undergraduate and graduate students in Computer Science to attend ICSE 2020.  \n   Keynote Plenary Sessions  \n \n \n \n   \n      \n     \n       \n   \n  \n    Dr. Nancy Leveson   Professor of Aeronautics  and Astronautics  MIT  \u0026nbsp;  \n    Dr. Peter O\u0027Hearn  Research Scientist at Facebook  and Professor at  University College London  \u0026nbsp;   \n    Dr. Chan-Mo Park   POSTECH Former President  / Chancellor  Pyongyang University of Science  and Technology (PUST)  \n  \n   \n   \n \n \n    Sponsors and Supporters  \n                                                 \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;         ",

      "Abstract": "Adoption of new digital technologies is impacting all aspects of the society. While these new technologies are accepted rapidly within the consumer segment, in the area of industrial control systems the pace of new aspects of computing and further distribution of control is moving slower. This is often due to the criticality and security constraints of such systems, since degraded or hijacked control could lead to injuries or competitive disadvantages. Nowadays a critical component of control systems is the key management protocol for protecting communication. This is specifically important as more and more devices become part of industrial control networks. The key management system must be reliable and robust in order to ensure stable operation of the system with minimum downtime. This often means that the system needs to be autonomous and dynamic, capable of periodically changing the keys automatically and authenticating the system components. Different techniques have been used to examine the reliability and robustness of the key management systems, one promising approach is by using formal methods. In this paper we present a formally verified key management system for use within distributed industrial control systems. We demonstrate that the key management system can reliably handle authentication/communication operations in real-time as well as joining/leaving of control units within the system. We use UPPAAL to analyse several security properties, showing that our models satisfy a collection of requirements defined by our industrial partner and are viable for dynamic key management applications."

      "Abstract": "Many software applications contain confidential information, which has to be prevented from leaking through unauthorized access. To enforce confidentiality, there are language-based security mechanisms that rely on information flow control. Typically, these mechanisms work post-hoc by checking whether confidential data is accessed unauthorizedly after the complete program is written. The disadvantage is that incomplete programs cannot be interpreted properly and information flow properties cannot be built in constructively. In this work, we present a methodology to construct programs incrementally using refinement rules to follow a lattice-based information flow policy. In every refinement step, confidentiality and functional correctness of the program is guaranteed, such that insecure programs are prohibited by construction. Our contribution is fourfold. We formalize refinement rules for information flow control-by-construction, prove soundness of the refinement rules, show that our approach has the same expressiveness as standard language-based mechanisms for information flow, and implement the approach in a graphical editor called CorC. Our methodology is also usable for integrity properties, which are dual to confidentiality."

      "Abstract": "Assurance cases are often a prerequisite for certification of critical systems. They show how a system is safe to operate, through a comprehensive argument demonstrating that each requirement has been satisfied, using suitable evidence, which often originates from formal methods. Indeed, assurance cases have the potential to improve applicability of formal methods in certification, by providing a human comprehensible presentation. Recently, we have developed Isabelle/SACM, a framework for developing assurance cases with integrated formal methods. In this paper we apply our framework to an autonomous underwater vehicle demonstrator. To achieve this we encode the SI unit system in Isabelle, to allow a data model and requirements using physical units. We present a behavioural model in the graphical RoboChart state machine language, embed the artifacts into Isabelle/SACM, and use it to demonstrate satisfaction of the requirements."

      "Abstract": "Software smells have negative impacts on the reliability and modifiability of software systems. The smells in architecture design can be cascaded down to the implementation level and cause issues that require much effort to fix. Therefore, early detection of the architecture smells can benefit the overall quality of the software system. This paper presents an integration of methods that formally define the software architecture design towards architecture smell detection. Our approach serves as a framework that allows the architectural structures and behaviours to be formally analysed based on a coherent principle. We evaluated the accuracy and performance of our approach with the models generated from open source projects. The results show that our approach is effective and functions well."

      "Abstract": "Formal methods used to validate software designs, like Alloy, OCL, and B, are powerful tools to reason about complex structures (e.g., architectures, object-relational mappings) captured as sets of relational constraints. However, their applicability is limited when software is subject to uncertainty (derived, e.g., from lack of control over third-party components, interaction with physical elements). In contrast, quantitative verification (a.k.a. probabilistic model checking) has emerged as a powerful way of providing quantitative guarantees about the performance, cost, and reliability of systems operating under uncertainty. However, quantitative verification methods do not retain the flexibility of relational modeling in describing structures, forcing engineers to trade structural reasoning for analytic capabilities that concern probabilistic and other quantitative guarantees. This paper contributes a method (HaiQ) that enhances structural modeling/synthesis with quantitative guarantees in the style provided by quantitative verification. It includes a language for describing structure and (stochastic) behavior of systems, and a temporal logic that allows checking probability and reward-based properties over sets of feasible design alternatives implicitly described by the relational constraints in a{HaiQ model. We report the results of applying a prototype tool in two domains, on which we show the feasibility of synthesizing structural designs that optimize probabilistic and other quantitative guarantees."

      "Abstract": "Active automata learning is a technique of querying black box systems and modelling their behaviour. In this paper, we aim to apply active learning in parts. We formalise the conditions on systems—with decomposable input—that make learning in parts possible. The systems are themselves decomposable through non-intersecting subsets of inputs. Learning these subsystems/components requires less time and resources. We prove that the technique works for both two components as well as an arbitrary number of components. We illustrate the usefulness of this technique through a classical example and through a real example from the industry."

      "Abstract": "In the context of robotic software, the selection of an appropriate planner is one of the most crucial software engineering decisions. Robot planners aim at computing plans (i.e., blueprint of actions) to accomplish a complex mission. While many planners have been proposed in the robotics literature, they are usually evaluated on showcase examples, making hard to understand whether they can be effectively (re)used for realising complex missions, with heterogeneous robots, and in real-world scenarios. In this paper we propose \\NAME{}, which wraps FM-based planners into a comprehensive software engineering framework, which allows considering complex robotic missions. We instantiated \\NAME{} by considering (i) realistic maps (e.g, fire escape maps) that describe the environment in which the robots are deployed; (ii) temporal logic for mission specification; and (iii) \\mc{} model checker to compute plans that satisfy mission specifications. We evaluated \\NAME{} by analyzing how it supports computing plans in real case scenarios, and by evaluating the generated plans in simulated and real environments. We considered both single-robot and multi-robots applications. The results show that while \\NAME{} is adequate for handling single-robot applications, the state explosion still represents a major barrier for reusing existing planners in multi-robot applications. Thus, we argument that additional effort, like the one described in this paper, is needed to fill the gap among FM-based planners and robotic SE-needs."

      "Abstract": "Industrial control systems are moving from isolated to distributed and cloud-connected architectures. While the operational benefits of this migration form the driving force for this trend, the necessary security assurance is often difficult to achieve. Formal methods, including model checking, provide capable technologies to deal with this challenge. However, when formal verification must account for the complexity of modern control systems the state space being explored grows drastically as more details are included in the analysis. This may eventually cause a state space explosion, which makes formal verification infeasible. To address this, we propose a method for decomposing cloud-connected control systems into modules representing the different parts of the system (clients, the cloud, the control network, etc.). Based on the decomposed version of the system, we use UPPAAL to analyse several well-known cyber attacks and formally verify the system’s behavior under these attacks. To determine viability of our approach we first use statistical model checking to assess the probabilities of success for selected attacks. Based on the probability outcomes, we use symbolic model checking to individually analyse the sub-systems affected by each attack. The results obtained from this analysis are then used to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. We demonstrate our method using a control system architecture provided by our industrial partner."

We further enrich the induced rules by simplification steps based on results from the combinatorial theory of word equations, as well as by the addition of linear length constraints. This transformation-system approach cannot solve all equations efficiently by itself, so our final approach integrates existing string solvers, which are called based on heuristics. Experimental evaluation shows that this technique is useful as an inprocessing method for existing solvers."

      "Abstract": "UML models are standard artifacts used by software engineers for designing software. As software is designed, different UML diagram types (e.g., class diagrams and sequence diagrams) are produced by software designers. Since the various UML diagram types describe different aspects of a software system, they are not independent but strongly depend on each other, hence they must be consistent. Inconsistencies cause faults of the final software systems. It is, therefore, paramount that they get detected, analyzed, and fixed. Consistency rules are a useful tool proposed in the literature to detect inconsistencies. They categorize syntactic constraints that help in identifying inconsistencies when violated. This case study aims at collecting and analyzing UML models with OCL consistency rules proposed in the literature and at promoting the development of a reference benchmark that can be reused by the (FM-)research community. We collected 33 UML consistency rules and 206 different UML diagrams contained in 34 open-source UML models presented in the literature. We propose an FM-based encoding of the consistency rules in OCL. This encoding allows analyzing whether the consistency rules are satisfied or violated within the 34 UML models. To assess the proposed benchmark, we analyzed how the UML models, consistency rules, diagram types contained in the benchmark help in assessing the consistency of UML models, and the consistency of diagrams across the different software development phases. Our results show that the considered UML models and consistency rules allowed identifying 2731 inconsistencies and that those inconsistencies refer to different software development phases. We concluded that the considered UML models and consistency rules could be considered as an initial benchmark that can be further extended by the research community."

      "Abstract": "A challenge that has gathered much attention in recent years is automated synthesis of correct-by-construction software systems from declarative specifcations. The specifcation language is typically a subset of linear temporal logic called generalized reactivity of rank 1, for which there exists an efcient synthesis algorithm. Specifications in this language model the system as the interaction between an environment and a controller, the former satisfying a set of assumptions and the latter a set of guarantees. In order for a solution to exist, a sufcient set of assumptions implying the guarantees must be provided. The assumptions must be as general as possible and small enough to be intelligible by engineers that need to assess their consistency with the true environment where the synthesized controller will operate. The search for such assumptions is generally a refinement approach driven by counterstrategies, characterizations of undesirable environment behaviors that force the violation of the guarantees; assumptions are progressively refined in order to exclude such behaviors. In this work we provide a heuristic to drive this counterstrategy-guided search towards smaller refinements. We define a concept of minimality of refinements with respect to counterstrategies and provide an algorithm that provably finds minimal refnements with little time overhead. We show experimentally that it consistently produces one or more shorter solutions than state of the art for a set of popular case studies. We also demonstrate that in a popular case study (AMBA-AHB protocol) our heuristic finds a close-to-optimal solution that cannot be found by previous fully automated approaches."

      "Abstract": "\\emph{Cyber-Physical Systems} (CPSs) are integrations of networking and distributed computing systems with physical processes. Although the range of their applications include several critical domains, the current trend is to verify and validate \\CPS{s} with simulation-test systems rather than formal methodologies. In this paper, we focus on the \\textsc{Modest Toolset} to implement a non-trivial quadruple-tank water system with the objective to do \\emph{statistical model checking} to analyze the impact of three \\emph{physics-based attacks}, \\emph{i.e.}, attacks targeting \\emph{sensors} and/or \\emph{actuators} of the system, with potential consequences on the safety of the physical process."

      "Abstract": "A wide range of interesting program properties are relational, i.e., they described a relation between two program runs. Two prominent relational properties are the regression verification (proving conditional program equivalence), and non-interference (proving the absence of information flow). The verification of relational properties is hardly accessible to engineers due to the lack of appropriate specification languages for relational properties. In previous work, we introduced the concept of generalized test tables: a table-based specification language, which allows the tight temporal specification of functional (non-relational)properties for reactive systems. We introduce relational test tables – an extension of generalized test tables for the specification of relational properties. Relational test tables support specification of $k$-safety properties (a superset of relational properties) between $k\\geq 2$ program runs. We show the applicability of relational test tables by specifying and verifying change scenarios and information flow of reactive systems. We provide an implementation of the verification pipeline for programs following the IEC 61131-3 coding standard."

      "Abstract": "In a distributed scenario it is possible to find systems consisting of independent parties that collaboratively execute a business process, but cannot disclose a subset of the data used in this process to each other. Such systems can be modelled using the PE-BPMN notation: a privacy-enhanced extension of the BPMN process modeling notation. Given a PE-BPMN model, we address the problem of verifying that the content of certain data objects is not leaked to unauthorized parties. To this end, we formalise the semantics of PE-BPMN collaboration diagrams via a translation into process algebraic specifications. This formalisation enables us to apply model checking to detect unintended data leakages in a PE-BPMN model. We specifically consider data leakages in the context of secret sharing technology. The approach has been implemented on top of the mCRL2 toolset, and integrated into the Pleak toolset supporting privacy analysis of business processes. The proposal has been evaluated using real scenarios."

      "Abstract": "Neural networks are powerful tools for automated decision-making, seeing increased application in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous driving. Due to their black-box nature and large scale, reasoning about their behavior is challenging. Statistical analysis is often used to infer probabilistic properties of a network, such as its robustness to noise and inaccurate inputs. While scalable, statistical methods can only provide probabilistic guarantees on the quality of their results and may underestimate the impact of low probability inputs leading to undesired behavior of the network. We investigate here the use of symbolic analysis and constraint solution space quantification to precisely quantify probabilistic properties in neural networks. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed technique in a case study involving the analysis of ACAS-Xu, a collision avoidance system for unmanned aircraft control."

      "Abstract": "Reactive synthesis is an automated procedure to obtain a correct-by-construction reactive system from a given declarative, temporal specification. Examples of these systems include the software controllers of robotic systems. Despite recent advancements on the theory and algorithms of reactive synthesis, e.g., efficient synthesis for the GR(1) fragment of linear temporal logic, many challenges remain in bringing reactive synthesis technologies to the hands of software engineers. The SYNTECH project is about bridging this gap. It addresses challenges that relate to the change from writing code to writing specifications, and the development of tools to support a specification-centric rather than a code-centric software development process. In this talk I will give an overview of the SYNTECH project’s results from the last five years. These include the Spectra specification language and Spectra Tools, a synthesizer and related analyses aiming at helping engineers write better specifications for synthesis. I will also present the application of Spectra to classic problems as well as to autonomous Lego robots and some example simulated systems, as developed by undergraduate computer science students in project classes we have taught. Finally, I will discuss new challenges and research opportunities. \nThe talk will cover results from papers in ESEC/FSE’15, ESEC/FSE’16, ESEC/FSE’17, ICSE’19, and FM’19. Joint work with Gal Amram, Elizabeth Firman, Aviv Kuvent, Or Pistiner, Jan O. Ringert, and Rafi Shalom. The project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 638049, SYNTECH).

The AR-based collaborative system can render annotations directly on an environment which helps local users easily recognize the original intention that the remote helper wants to deliver. We introduce how the application work."

      "Abstract": "Monkey testing is a random testing technique in which a monkey, i.e. a fully-automated testing tool, fires a stream of pseudo-random events on the GUI of the application under test, usually with the purpose of GUI testing, crash testing or responsiveness analysis. A line of research is dedicated to addressing limitations of monkey testing for Android apps. However all the existing works are based on the implicit assumption that the inefficiencies of monkey testing is only due to the weakness of the monkey and hence, it is the monkey which needs to be improved. Our vision contradicts this since we believe even an existing monkey testing tool, e.g. the Google’s official monkey tool shipped with Android SDK, is able to provide better performance if the app goes through some level of GUI refactoring. Our point of view is that part of the inefficiency of monkey testing is due to the fact that the GUI of the app is designed to be user-friendly, having good look and feel for the user. However, it is possible to automatically refactor the GUI of the app to become monkey-friendly, i.e. to change in a way that it provides more readiness and potential for being tested by monkey. We have provided two concrete examples to realize this vision, each seeking to address one of the problems of monkey testing: 1) widget-obliviousness and 2) the lack of support for user involvement during testing. The first example is implemented as a plugin for Android Studio and a case study is performed on a real-world app. While the evaluation is in early stages, the results are promising."

When Google announces a new release, a whole chain of changes is triggered in cascade, causing many compatibility issues. Objective: This study focus at performing a quantitative and qualitative analysis on the state of apps readiness for new Android releases over time. Method: We performed an empirical study to map apps readiness to different Android versions. We developed a Repository Mining Tool to analyse 8420 open-source repositories, detecting 2118 Android projects and when they were adapted to different Android versions along their lifetimes. Results: Our results show that Android apps have became “less ready” over time. We found that 76.45% of the analysed apps were ready for Android Lollipop 5.0 (API level 21) release, in October 2014. Though only 5.46% were ready for Android 10 (API level 29), in September 2019. In addition, our results show that when apps are adapted to an Android version, 59.41% perform the adaptation until the new Android release month, 95% are adapted twelve months after the release, and 99.16% are adapted two years later. Conclusion: Our findings reveal implications that affect not only the Android or mobile development research field and developers, they also reveal implications that points to Google’s policies and Android final users as well."

      "Abstract": "Android platform has dominated the smart phone market for years now and, consequently, gained a lot of attention from attackers. Malicious apps (malware) pose a serious threat to the security and privacy of Android smart phone users. Available approaches to detect mobile malware based on machine learning rely on features extracted with static analysis or dynamic analysis techniques. Different types of machine learning classifiers (such as support vector machine and random forest) deep learning classifiers (based on deep neural networks) are then trained on the extracted features, to produce models that can be used to detect mobile malware. The usually-analyzed features include permissions requested/used, frequency of API calls, use of API calls, and sequence of API calls. The API calls are analyzed at various granularity levels such as method, class, package, and family. \nIn the view of the proposals of different types of classifiers and the use of different types of features and different underlying analyses used for feature extraction, there is a need for a comprehensive evaluation on the effectiveness of the current state-of-the-art in malware detection on a common benchmark. This paper evaluates several conventional machine learning classifiers and deep learning classifiers and the use of different types of features, which characterize the use of API calls at class level and the sequence of API calls at method level. Features have been extracted from a common benchmark of 4572 benign samples and 2399 malware samples, using both static analysis and dynamic analysis. \nAmong other interesting findings, we observed that classifiers trained on the use of API calls generally perform better than those trained on the sequence of API calls. Classifiers trained on static analysis-based features perform better than those trained on dynamic analysis-based features. Deep learning classifiers, despite their sophistication, are not necessarily better than conventional classifiers, especially when they are not optimized. However, deep learning classifiers do perform better than conventional classifiers when trained on dynamic analysis-based features."

Recent advances in deep neural networks that have been trained on large sketch stroke sequence sample collections have enabled online sketch detection that supports many sketch element classes at high classification accuracy. This paper leverages the recent Google Quick, Draw! dataset of 50M sketch stroke sequences to pre-train a recurrent neural network and retrains it with sketch stroke sequences we collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk. The resulting Doodle2App website offers a substitute for paper, i.e., a drawing interface and an interactive UI preview and can convert sketches to a compilable Android application. On 712 sketch samples Doodle2App achieved higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art tool Teleport. The demo video is at https://youtu.be/P4sb0pKTNEY"

      "Abstract": "An earthquake detection and response system is crucial due to the fatal nature of earthquakes. Recently, extensive research efforts have been made to detect earthquakes in real time and give an alert by incorporating with server-based systems or by working as a stand-alone device. However, such approaches still have many challenges due to the cost of network and server infrastructures or the inaccuracy of detection algorithms. In this work, we introduce a collaborative approach using smart devices located in a near area to detect earthquakes and issue an alert with detailed action plans. A smartphone’s accelerometer works as a seismic sensor to monitor ground motions when it is in a steady state. Once an earthquake-like motion is detected, it is sent to nearby devices through D2D communications to confirm it as an earthquake. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach can be effective in a home environment or an earthquake early warning system is not present."

      "Abstract": "Context. Since today mobile devices have limited battery life, the energy consumption of the software running on them can play a strong role with respect to the success of mobile-based businesses. Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are built using common web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and are commonly used for providing a better user experience to mobile users. Caching is the main technique used by PWA developers for optimizing network usage and for providing a meaningful experience even when the user’s device is offline. \nGoal. This paper aims at assessing the impact of caching on both the energy consumption and performance of PWAs. \nMethod. We conducted an empirical experiment targeting 9 real PWAs developed by third-party developers. The experiment is designed as a 1 factor - 2 treatments study, with the usage of caching as the single factor and the status of the cache as treatments (empty vs populated cache). The response variables of the experiment are (i) the energy consumption of the mobile device and (ii) the page load time of the PWAs. The experiment is executed on a real Android device running the Mozilla Firefox browser. \nResults. Our results show that PWAs do not consume significantly different amounts of energy when loaded either with an empty or populated cache. However, the page load time of PWAs is significantly lower when the cache is already populated, with a medium effect size. \nConclusions. This study confirms that PWAs are promising in terms of energy consumption and provides evidence that caching can be safely exploited by PWA developers concerned with energy consumption. The study provides also empirical evidence that caching is an effective technique for improving the user experience in terms of page loading time of PWAs."

In this context, it is crucially important to arm mobile software engineers with effective and practical tool support that is informed and enabled by a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of this ecosystem. Targeting Android, we envision to build an infrastructure that is capable of systematically and continuously mining a mobile software ecosystem. Using this infrastructure, we then perform large-scale longitudinal characterization studies of the ecosystem to understand its evolutionary dynamics with a focus on the behavioral evolution patterns of, and ecological interaction among, three ecosystem elements: the mobile platforms, user apps built on the platforms, and users associated with the apps (including end users and developers). Further, the characterization results enable proactive app quality and sustainable app security. We also report our current progress in this effort with initial results, and discuss risks and next steps."

      "Abstract": "Android operating system introduce new releases frequently. This fact led to the existence of several Android Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) which is one of the causes the Android fragmentation phenomenon. As a consequence of the fragmentation, many apps became not ready for new Android releases.Aiming to investigate the readiness of Android apps, we developed a software repository mining tool to understand how ready apps are (and were) for new Android releases. The tool tracks the changes of Android projects properties over time, contributing for a deeper analysis through collecting data since the beginning of the projects. It allows researchers to examine when exactly Android properties were changed, how many times they were changed, as well as all their values along time. This mechanism can support researchers to understand the evolution of Android projects and to answer research questions. In addition, developers can use the tool to track their apps evolution and perform comparisons and analysis with other open source apps. The tool can help developers to have a broader view of their apps evolution as well as to analyze competitor apps evolution."

      "Abstract": "During this still increasing proliferation age of mobile devices, much of human-computer interaction involves text input, and the task of typing text is provided via virtual keyboards. In a mobile setting, energy consumption is a key concern for both hardware manufacturers and software developers. Virtual keyboards are software applications, and thus, they may have a significant impact on the overall energy consumption of the underlying device. \nEnergy consumption analysis and optimization of mobile software is recent and active area of research. Surprisingly, there is no study analysing the energy efficiency of the most used software keyboards and evaluating the performance advantage of its features. In this paper we analyse the energy performance of virtual keyboards and its respective impact in mobile devices operation. We studied the energy performance of five of the most used keyboards in the Android ecosystem. We conduct and present the results of two studies: one where we instructed the keyboards to simulate the writing of a predefined input text, and another where we performed an empirical study with real users and we monitored the energy consumption of the device when writing the same text. Moreover, we measure and analyse the energy consumption in different keyboard scenarios, namely with or without using word prediction. Our studies show that exist relevant performance differences among the most used keyboards of the considered ecosystem, and it possible to save nearly 18% of energy by replacing the most used keyboard in Android by the most efficient one. We also showed that is possible to save both energy and time by disabling keyboard intrinsic features and that the use of word suggestions not always compensate for energy and time."

      "Abstract": "Nowadays mobile users are constantly being connected and increasingly asked to express their personal preferences in the digital world. User preferences deal with simple device settings options, like notification alarms, as well as ethical relevant choices relating to the user behavior, privacy ones included (e.g., concerning the unauthorized disclosure and mining of personal data, as well as the access to restricted resources). All these preferences define the user, they are the building blocks of her digital identity and will be increasingly important given the growing rise of autonomous technologies and their ethical implications. The settings that enable these preferences are often hard to locate and hard to understand, even in popular apps and operating systems. Moreover, they can expose privacy, be employed for profiling or exploited for malicious activities. In this landscape, we devise the introduction of a \\textit{Personal Preferences Automation Module} (PPAM) capable of automatically inferring, applying and enforcing user choices in multiple scenarios ranging from speeding up simple time consuming tasks to the management of ethical sensitive choices. The wide range of sensors and devices that can be found in mobile domain makes it a privileged context in which to be able to implement the system we are describing. In this paper, we present two application scenarios and describe the proposed approach at work on it."

In the Android ecosystem, obfuscation tools are available to optimize, reduce the size and protect the intellectual properties of apps. However, despite the clear advantages provided by obfuscation most apps do not use it, often because of the difficulties induced by the usage of obfuscation which requires writing rules to keep a usable app. In this paper, we identify the concrete challenges encountered by app developers who wish to use obfuscation in their apps. In addition, we propose an approach using crowdsourcing to automatically generate rules, when static analysis is not sufficient. With the knowledge gained from hundreds of projects, we hope to lighten the burden on developers when writing rules."

      "Abstract": "Dynamic analysis is an important tool for assessing software quality during testing. It not only helps analysts identify performance bottlenecks and functional errors, but also provides a means for finding security vulnerabilities. For example, analysts can determine the servers to which a mobile app connects, which sensitive data it transfers, and which cryptographic protocols it uses for the transfer. While many approaches for monitoring a running Android app exist, most work silently assumes that a suitable execution environment is available. When analyzing hundreds of apps at the same time, however, a single phone on the analyst’s desk is not enough. Emulators are not always an alternative as we show, because apps can behave differently on real hardware. \nIn this paper, we discuss the challenges for providing a largescale testing environment with real Android devices on physical hardware. We further present DFarm, a software and hardware system to configure and control hundreds of Android phones in a private testing cloud. We discuss electrical wiring, USB and WiFi connectivity, automatic configuration, and load balancing. We evaluate DFarm on a range between 1 and more than 70 devices. We show that it provides linear scaling for dynamic app analysis when adding new devices, while retaining the original device’s computation and network performance."

      "Abstract": "To provide their functionality, mobile apps interact extensively with the application programming interface (API) of the underlying operating system. Given that the API frequently evolves to incorporate crucial improvements, app developers are periodically required to update API usages in their apps to ensure that the apps behave as expected when running on the new API. To help developers with this tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming task, we defined a technique for automated API migration and implemented it in a tool called APIMigrator that supports Android apps. APIMigrator (1) automatically migrates API usages within an app by leveraging how developers of other apps migrated corresponding API usages and (2) validates the migrations through differential testing. We evaluated APIMigrator on a benchmark of 15 real-world apps and obtained promising results. Overall, our tool was able to migrate 85% of the API usages considered and validated 68% of these migrations. We provide a demo video of the tool at https://youtu.be/v0VfpKi_IDc."

      "Abstract": "To enable app interoperability, the Android platform exposes APIs that allow developers to query for the list of apps installed on a user’s device. These Installed Application Methods (IAMs) require no special authorization and it is known that information collected through these methods can be used to precisely deduce end-users interests and personal traits, thus raising privacy concerns. \nIn this paper we present a large-scale empirical study investigating the presence of IAMs in Android apps and their usage by Android developers. The study targets 14,342 free Android apps published in the Google Play Store and 7,886 open-source Android applications mined from GitHub. In our analysis, we first detect which apps employ IAMs. We then extracts information related to the fields accessed through these APIs. Finally, we check whether IAM calls are performed in the app’s own code or by an included third-party library. In addition to our analysis, we investigate whether developers are aware of the presence of IAMs in their apps by means of an online questionnaire. \nOur results highlight that: (i) IAMs are widely used in commercial applications while their popularity is limited in open-source ones; (ii) in both open- and closed-source apps IAMs are mostly used in third-party libraries; (iii) more than one third of libraries that employ IAMs are advertisement libraries and roughly one other third are utility libraries; (iv) a small number of popular advertisement libraries account for over 33% of all usages of IAMs by third-party libraries; (v) developers are not always aware that their apps include IAMs calls, often introduced by enclosed third-party libraries. \nBased on the collected data, we suggest some changes to the Android platform to deal with identified issues, provide recommendations to end-users and highlight directions for future research."

      "Abstract": "In Android, inter-app communication is a cornerstone feature where apps exchange special messages called Intents in order to integrate with each other and deliver a rich end-user experience. In particular, in case an app is granted special permission, it can dispatch privileged Intents to request sensitive tasks to system components. \nHowever, a malicious app might hijack a defective privileged app and exploit it as a proxy, to forward attacking Intents to system components. We call this threat “Second Order Permission Re-delegation” vulnerability. \nIn this paper, we present (i) a detailed description of this novel vulnerability and (ii) our approach based on static analysis and automated test cases generation to detect (and document) instances of this vulnerability. We empirically evaluated our approach on a large set of top Google Play apps. Results suggest that this novel vulnerability is neglected by state of the art, but that it is common even among popular apps. In fact, our approach found 27 real vulnerabilities with fast analysis time, while a state-of-the-art static analysis tool could find none of them."

For mobile applications most of the research has been done for Android with very little research done for iOS. Although Android has the largest market share, iOS is a very popular platform. Our goal is to understand the distribution of code smells in iOS applications and to see how it compares to Android. We also look at the relationship between testing and code smells and the evolution of code smells in iOS applications. For this analysis we used a collaborative list of open source iOS applications from GitHub. We combined code smells defined by Fowler and object oriented code smells studied on Android. We developed a tool that can detect these code smells in Swift applications. We observed that most newer versions of applications had more code smells than their older versions. We also compared the occurrences of code smells that are common to both iOS and Android and saw that their distributions differ. We were not able to establish a link between the number of code smells and the number of tests but discovered that most open source iOS applications seem to be poorly tested."

      "Abstract": "Android applications rely heavily on strings for sensitive operations like reflection, access to system resources, URL connections, database access, among others. Thus, insight into application behavior can be gained through not only an analysis of what strings an application creates but also the structure of the computation used to create theses strings, and in what manner are these strings used. In this paper we introduce a static analysis of Android applications to discover strings, how they are created, and their usage. The output of our static analysis contains all of this information in the form of a graph which we call a string computation. We leverage the results to classify individual application behavior with respect to malicious or benign intent. Unlike previous work that has focused only on extraction of string values, our approach leverages the structure of the computation used to generate string values as features to perform classification of Android applications. That is, we use none of the static analysis computed string values, rather using only the graph structures of created strings to do classification of an arbitrary Android application as malware or benign. Our results show that leveraging string computation structures as features can yield precision and recall rates as high as 97% on modern malware. We also provide baseline results using other malware detection techniques using the same corpus of applications."

      "Abstract": "In mobile devices, the battery is a limited resource and mobile apps are designed with this constraint in mind. To speed up development, app developers often use third-party libraries. Researchers have found that third-party libraries for ads and billing excessively use mobile resources. Other often used third-party libraries such as Android third-party HTTP libraries have received less attention from research regarding energy consumption. To fill this gap, we investigated whether popular Android third-party HTTP libraries vary in energy consumption. In addition, we checked whether there is a correlation between performance and energy consumption. To achieve this goal, we performed a controlled experiment. We created 45 different versions of a custom app and explored the energy consumption and performance of eight popular Android third-party HTTP libraries in five typical use cases. We found that there is a significant variance of energy consumption between the selected Android third-party HTTP libraries. The energy drivers are related to the internal structure of the Android third-party HTTP libraries, in particular with the handling of asynchronous tasks and the creation of multiple threads in the background. We did not find significant correlation between performance and energy consumption in most of the versions. Our results will help app developers make better choices when selecting Android third-party HTTP libraries. Future studies investigating the interdependencies between performance, malware detection, maintenance, energy efficiency and other quality dimensions of Android app code could also benefit from our results."

That is why developers consistently analyze user feedback to identify recently emerged issues. \nWe have submitted our work in ACM MobileSoft 2020 where the findings of elaborate empirical study on supervised text classification and topic modeling approaches were reported for isolating energy related reviews from the hoard of feedback and for identifying recently emerged issues. We empirically studied and compared the accuracy, F1-score and run time of 60 machine-learning models with relevant feature combinations and 30 Neural Network-based models developed using six neural network architectures and three word embedding. Furthermore, we experimented the most frequently used string matching with results obtained from applying two of the state-of-the-art topic modeling algorithms in order to compare the techniques and to help the developers investigate the emerging issues responsible for energy inefficiency of the apps. \nThe proposed interactive visualization tool make it easy for the developers to traverse through the extensive result set generated by the text classification and topic modeling approaches and help them to better comprehend the outcomes of implemented model feature combinations, algorithms used. The data structure used for the tool stores the outcomes of discussed approaches and cumulatively updates itself whenever new developer performs any of the given approaches with a new data-set. This tool also gives developers choices to illustrate the result set as a whole, as a chunk, or as a gradual step-by-step representation."

      "Abstract": "Many software development processes rely on quality gates. However, these quality gates often do not work as expected since they are heavyweight and provide feedback too late. As a result, quality gates fail to assure quality and cannot stop the quality erosion of software. In this talk, I explain how recent developments in the area of code collaboration platforms (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, …) support a more lightweight and more effective type of quality gates: These “quality doors” enable ultra short feedback cycles to an extent that would have been inconceivable a few years ago. They are facilitated through recent innovations, e.g. infrastructure as code, but also integrate well-established methods like code reviews. First industry experiences give hope that through this approach, quality assurance finally becomes an integral part of the software development process instead of being an afterthought. On a side note, I explain why I stopped using the term “technical debt”."

      "Abstract": "While engineers are increasingly aware of security requirements, in many organizations security remains the responsibility of “those security people” and is not tightly integrated into the development cycle. Productivity and feature goals can result in engineers focusing on deployment rather than on fixing non-critical security issues or on building security into a product, resulting in an increase of security technical debt. Attackers eagerly exploit the vulnerabilities lying in the security technical debt pile. Organizations can benefit from risk-based practices for shrinking this debt. This talk will present two research projects in which risk is being used to prioritize security mitigations. The first project is focused on reducing secrets and credentials that have been checked into a code base. The second project relates to the prioritization of patching the continuous onslaught of vulnerable components and libraries that comprise a product."

      "Abstract": "This keynote discusses a radically unconventional approach to developing robots: using evolution. Artificial evolution has been successful in optimization and design in the field of Evolutionary Computing; applying it to developing robots implies huge challenges and great promises, [1],  [2], [3]. The long-term vision foresees robots that reproduce and evolve in real-time and real space. Possible application scenarios can be divided into two categories depending on the extent of human involvement. First, the “breeding farm scenario”, where humans steer and accelerate evolution through influencing selection (and possibly also reproduction) until a good robot design emerges in the environment of the “breeding farm”. This design can then be validated, produced and employed on a large scale in the real application environment, e.g., cave systems, deep seas, rainforests. Second, the “other planet scenario”, where the robot population evolves and adapts autonomously to the unknown environment without the need for direct human oversight. In this case, evolution is not merely a design method that stops when the outcome is satisfactory, but a permanent force that continually improves and adapts the population to the given circumstances. While at the current level of technology this may sound more fiction than science, the quick development of 3D-printing and autonomous assembly can make this a feasible option in the near future. As of today, the overall system architecture has been designed [4], and the first proofs-of concept with automated robot (re)production have been published [5], [6]. To illustrate specific aspects I will reflect on an ongoing EPSRC project that is developing the first evolutionary robot system where robots evolve in a breeding farm scenario [7]. "

      "Abstract": "Self-adaptive systems continuously adapt to internal and external changes in their execution environment. In context-based self-adaptation, adaptations take place in response to the characteristics of the execution environment, captured as a context. However, in large-scale adaptive systems operating in dynamic environments, multiple contexts are often active at the same time, requiring simultaneous execution of multiple adaptations. Complex interactions between such adaptations might not have been foreseen or accounted for at design time. For example, adaptations can partially overlap, requiring only partial execution of each, or they can be conflicting, requiring some of the adaptations not to be executed at all, in order to preserve system execution. To ensure a correct composition of adaptations, we propose ComInA, a novel reinforcement learning based approach, which autonomously learns interactions between adaptations as well as the most appropriate adaptation composition for each combination of active contexts, as they arise. We present an initial evaluation of ComInA in an urban public transport network simulation, where multiple adaptations to buses, routes, and stations are required. Early results show that ComInA correctly identifies whether adaptations are compatible or conflicting and learns to execute adaptations which maximize system performance. However, further investigation is needed into how best to utilize such identified relationships to optimize a wider range of metrics and utilize more complex composition strategies."

      "Abstract": "Recent approaches in testing autonomous driving systems (ADS) are able to generate a scenario in which the autonomous car collides , and a different ADS configuration that avoids the collision. However, such test information is too low level to be used by engineers to improve the ADS. In this paper, we consider a path planner component provided by our industry partner, that can be configured through some weights. We propose a technique to automatically re-engineer the path planner in terms of a self-adaptive path planner (SAPP) following the MAPE loop reference architecture. The Knowledge Base (KB) of SAPP contains descriptions of collision scenarios discovered with testing, and the corresponding alternative weights that avoid the collisions. We forecast two main usages of SAPP. First of all, designers are provided with a prototype that should facilitate the re-implementation of the path planner. As second usage, SAPP can be useful for improving the diversity of testing, as performing test case generation on SAPP will guarantee to find dangerous situations different from those used to build SAPP. Preliminary experiments indicate that SAPP can effectively adapt on the base of the solutions stored in KB."

      "Abstract": "Self-Adaptive Systems (SASs) reflect on both their state and on the environment and change their behavior to satisfy the expected objectives. Cloud systems are self-adaptive by nature, especially considering the resources used in a pay-as-you-go manner. Satisfying trustworthiness (worthiness of a service based on evidences of its trust) properties also demands self-adaptation capabilities. Unfortunately, developers lack an easy-to-use platform to support the assessment of such properties and to execute the required adaptions. This paper presents TMA, a platform that implements a MAPE-K control loop for cloud systems, supported by a distributed monitoring system based on probes. Quality Models are used to express trustworthiness properties, resulting in scores, which are used to plan adaptations through evaluation rules. These plans are executed by actuators. A demo shows the scaling up/down of the number of containers in a cloud application of a set of web services from TPC Benchmarks, as a result of changes observed in the environment."

      "Abstract": "In the last four years, the number of distinct autonomous vehicles platforms deployed in the streets of California increased 6-fold, while the reported accidents increased 12-fold. This can become a trend with no signs of subsiding as it is fueled by a constant stream of innovations in hardware sensors and machine learning software. Meanwhile, if we expect the public and regulators to trust the autonomous vehicle platforms, we need to find better ways to solve the problem of adding technological complexity without increasing the risk of accidents. We studied this problem from the perspective of reliability engineering in which a given risk of an accident has an associated severity and probability of occurring. Timely information on accidents is important for engineers to anticipate and reuse previous failures to approximate the risk of accidents in a new city. However, this is challenging in the context of autonomous vehicles because of the sparse nature of data on the operational scenarios (driving trajectories in a new city). Our approach was to mitigate data sparsity by reducing the state space through the monitoring of multiple-vehicles operations. We then minimized the risk of accidents by determining proper allocation of tests for each equivalence class. Our contributions comprise (1) a set of strategies to monitor the operational data of multiple autonomous vehicles, (2) a Bayesian model that estimates changes in the risk of accidents, and (3) a feedback control-loop that minimizes these risks by reallocating test effort. Our results are promising in a sense that we were able to measure and control risk for a diversity of changes in the operational scenarios. We evaluated our models with data from two real cities with distinct traffic patterns and made the data available for the community."

      "Abstract": "Many self-adaptive systems benefit from human involvement and oversight, where a human operator can provide expertise not available to the system and can detect problems that the system is unaware of. One way of achieving this is by placing the human operator on the loop – i.e., providing supervisory oversight and intervening in the case of questionable adaptation decisions. To make such interaction effective, explanation is sometimes helpful to allow the human to understand why the system is making certain decisions and calibrate confidence from the human perspective. However, explanations come with costs in terms of delayed actions and the possibility that a human may make a bad judgement. Hence, it is not always obvious whether explanations will improve overall utility and, if so, what kinds of explanation to provide to the operator. In this work, we define a formal framework for reasoning about explanations of adaptive system behaviors and the conditions under which they are warranted. Specifically, we characterize explanations in terms of explanation content, effect, and cost. We then present a dynamic adaptation approach that leverages a probabilistic reasoning technique to determine when the explanation should be used in order to improve overall system utility."

      "Abstract": "The rapidly changing workload of service-based systems can easily cause under-/over-utilization on the component services, which can consequently affect the overall Quality of Service (QoS), such as latency. Self-adaptive services composition rectifies this problem, but poses several challenges: (i) the effectiveness of adaptation can deteriorate due to over-optimistic assumptions on the latency and utilization constraints, at both local and global levels; and (ii) the benefits brought by each composition plan is often short term and is not often designed for long-term benefits – a natural prerequisite for sustaining the system. To tackle these issues, we propose a two levels constraint reasoning framework for sustainable self-adaptive services composition, called DATESSO. In particular, DATESSO consists of a re ned formulation that differentiates the “strictness” for latency/utilization constraints in two levels. To strive for long-term benefits, DATESSO leverages the concept of technical debt and time-series prediction to model the utility contribution of the component services in the composition. The approach embeds a debt-aware two level constraint reasoning algorithm in DATESSO to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of self-adaptive service composition. We evaluate DATESSO on a service-based system with real-world WS-DREAM dataset and comparing it with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of DATESSO over the others on the utilization, latency and running time whilst likely to be more sustainable."

      "Abstract": "Self-adaptive Systems (SASs) are one way to address the ever growing complexity of software systems by allowing the system to react on changes in its operating environment. In today’s systems, self-adaptation is typically realized with a control loop, from which the MAPE-K feedback loop is a prominent example. Research uses the notion of patterns to describe the distribution and decentralization of individual control loop components or control loops and their underlying managed subsystems. While there are some well accepted standards about which components an managed subsystem has to implement so that it can interact with the control loop, research still lacks best practices for communication within and across control loops. This paper aims to identify several research challenges which exist currently in this domain. Furthermore, ideas on upcoming research to create distributed SASs on the basis of roles, distributed benchmarks for SASs and inter- and intra-communication for control loops will be presented. The relation between communication in control loops and distributed benchmarking will be introduced and ongoing work on a self-adaptive distributed benchmarking application will be discussed. Next, an evaluation strategy will be presented to provide evidence for viable results to the community. Finally, a research roadmap to tackle the discussed challenges is presented."

      "Abstract": "A distributed system’s functionality must continuously evolve, especially when environmental context changes. Such required evolution imposes unbearable complexity on system development. An alternative is to make systems able to self-adapt by opportunistically composing at runtime to generate systems of systems (SoSs) that offer value-added functionality. The success of such an approach calls for abstracting the heterogeneity of systems and enabling the programmatic construction of SoSs with minimal developer intervention. We propose a general ontology-based approach to describe distributed systems, seeking to achieve abstraction and enable runtime reasoning between systems. We also propose an architecture for systems that utilize such ontologies to enable systems to discover and ‘understand’ each other, and potentially compose, all at runtime. We detail features of the ontology and the architecture through two contrasting case studies: one on controlling multiple systems in smart home environment, and another on the management of dynamic computing clusters. We also quantitatively evaluate the scalability and validity of our approach through experiments and simulations. Our approach enables system developers to focus on high-level SoS composition without being constrained by deployment-specific implementation details"

      "Abstract": "The main goal of any feedback control system is essentially to remove humans from the loop. This has always been the goal in the engineering of control systems. The MAPE-K loop is the embodiment of a feedback control loop in self-adaptive software systems, but the complete removal of humans from the control loop has not been thoroughly debated. One of the reasons is that, software systems are social-technical systems, and as such, humans need to be considered right from the inception of such systems, otherwise their deployment is bound to fail. However, as software self-adaptation progresses, enabling to place higher assurances on the deployment of these systems to the point humans become dispensable, some ethical questions need to be raised. Similar questions have been raised in past when the first automatic systems became intrinsic to the industrial fabric. The difference between then and now is that then the impact was confined to portions of the society, but now the implications are much wider, if we consider, in particular, software systems that are able to change themselves. If humans are not aware of those changes, and their implications, humans cease to be in tune with the system they are operating, and inevitably accidents will ensue. The point of no return in self-adaptive software systems refers to the moment in their technical maturity when any human involvement with the operation of a system is perceived to create more harm than benefit. Confronted with this situation, software engineers need start asking themselves some basic ethical questions. Do we really need to consider humans as an integral part of self-adaptive software systems? If humans are removed from the control loop, what kind of assurances will be needed for society to accept such systems?"

      "Abstract": "Advanced systems such as IoT comprise many heterogeneous, interconnected, and autonomous entities operating in often highly dynamic environments. Due to their large scale and complexity, large volumes of monitoring data are generated and need to be stored, retrieved, and mined in a time- and resource-efficient manner. Architectural self-adaptation automates the control, orchestration, and operation of such systems. This can only be achieved via sophisticated decision-making schemes supported by monitoring data that fully captures the system behavior and its history. \nEmploying model-driven engineering techniques we propose a highly scalable, history-aware approach to store and retrieve monitoring data in form of enriched runtime models. We take advantage of rule-based adaptation where change events in the system trigger adaptation rules. We first present a scheme to incrementally check model queries in the form of temporal logic formulas which represent the conditions of adaptation rules against a runtime model with history. Then we enhance the model to retain only information that is temporally relevant to the queries, therefore reducing the accumulation of information to a required minimum. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of our approach via experiments on a simulated smart healthcare system employing a real-world medical guideline."

      "Abstract": "Attacks against business logic rules occur when the attacker exploits the domain rules in a malicious way. Such logic attacks have not received sufficient attention in research so far. In this paper, we propose a novel self-protecting approach that defends a system against the exploitation of business logic vulnerabilities. The approach empowers a system with a self-protecting layer to protect it against attacks that misusing business logic rules. The appraoch maintains up-to-date domain knowledge that is analyzed using runtime verification (RV) to detect logical attacks. When attacks are discovered they are dynamically mitigated by applying proper system reconfigurations. We evaluate the approach using a case in the domain of hotel booking systems."

      "Abstract": "Neural networks are powerful tools for automated decision-making, seeing increased application in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous driving. Due to their black-box nature and large scale, reasoning about their behavior is challenging. Statistical analysis is often used to infer probabilistic properties of a network, such as its robustness to noise and inaccurate inputs. While scalable, statistical methods can only provide probabilistic guarantees on the quality of their results and may underestimate the impact of low probability inputs leading to undesired behavior of the network. \nWe investigate here the use of symbolic analysis and constraint solution space quantification to precisely quantify probabilistic properties in neural networks. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed technique in a case study involving the analysis of ACAS-Xu, a collision avoidance system for unmanned aircraft control."

      "Abstract": "Self-adaptive systems increasingly need to reason about and adapt both structural and behavioral system aspects, such as in mobile service robots, which must reason about missions that they need to achieve and the architecture of the software executing them. Deciding how to best adapt these systems to run time changes is challenging because it entails considering mutual dependencies between the software architecture that the system is running and the outcome of plans for completing tasks, while also considering multiple trade-offs and uncertainties. Considering all these aspects in planning for adaptation often yields large solution spaces which cannot be adequately explored at run time. We address this challenge by proposing a planning approach able to consider the impact of mutual dependencies between software architecture and task planning on the satisfaction of mission goals. The approach is able to reason quantitatively about the outcome of adaptation decisions handling both the reconfiguration of the system’s architecture and adaptation of task plans under uncertainty and in a rich trade-off space. Our results show: (i) feasibility of run-time decision-making for self-adaptation in an otherwise intractable solution space by dividing-and-conquering adaptation into architecture reconfiguration and task planning sub-problems, and (ii) improved quality of adaptation decisions with respect to decision making that does not consider dependencies between architecture and task planning."

      "Abstract": "Two of the main paradigms used to build adaptive software employ different types of properties to capture relevant aspects of the system’s run-time behavior. On the one hand, control systems consider properties that concern static aspects like stability, as well as dynamic properties that capture the transient evolution of variables such as settling time. On the other hand, self-adaptive systems consider mostly non-functional properties that capture concerns such as performance, reliability, and cost. In general, it is not easy to reconcile these two types of properties or identify under which conditions they constitute a good fit to provide run-time guarantees. There is a need of identifying the key properties in the areas of control and self-adaptation, as well as of characterizing and mapping them to better understand how they relate and possibly complement each other. In this paper, we take a first step to tackle this problem by: (1) identifying a set of key properties in control theory, (2) illustrating the formalization of some of these properties employing temporal logic languages commonly used to engineer self-adaptive software systems, and (3) illustrating how to map key properties that characterize self-adaptive software systems into control properties, leveraging their formalization in temporal logics. We illustrate the different steps of the mapping on an exemplar case in the cloud computing domain and conclude with identifying open challenges in the area."

      "Abstract": "Control theoretical techniques have been successfully adopted as methods for self-adaptive systems design to provide formal guarantees about the effectiveness and robustness of adaptation mechanisms. However, the computational effort to obtain guarantees poses severe constraints when it comes to dynamic adaptation. In order to solve these limitations, in this paper, we propose a hybrid approach combining software engineering, control theory, and AI to design for software self-adaptation. Our solution proposes a hierarchical and dynamic system manager with performance tuning. Due to the gap between high-level requirements specification and the internal knob behavior of the managed system, a hierarchically composed components architecture seek the separation of concerns towards a dynamic solution. Therefore, a two-layered adaptive manager was designed to satisfy the software requirements with parameters optimization through regression analysis and evolutionary meta-heuristic. The optimization relies on the collection and processing of performance, effectiveness, and robustness metrics w.r.t control theoretical metrics at the offline and online stages. We evaluate our work with a prototype of the Body Sensor Network (BSN) in the healthcare domain, which is largely used as a demonstrator by the community. The BSN was implemented under the Robot Operating System (ROS) architecture, and concerns about the system dependability are taken as adaptation goals. Our results reinforce the necessity of performing well on such a safety-critical domain and contribute with substantial evidence on how hybrid approaches that combine control and AI-based techniques for engineering self-adaptive systems can provide effective adaptation."

      "Abstract": "Code smells are symptoms of poor implementation choices applied during software evolution. While previous research has devoted a notable effort in the definition of automated solutions to detect them in source code, still little is known on how to support developers when prioritizing them. Some works attempted to deliver solutions that can rank smell instances based on their severity, computed on the basis of software metrics. However, this may not be enough since it has been shown that the recommendations provided by current approaches do not take the developer’s perception of design issues into account. In this paper, we perform a first step toward the concept of emph{developer-driven} code smell prioritization and propose a machine learner able to rank code smells according to the perceived criticality that developers assign to them. We test our technique in an empirical study to investigate its accuracy but also the features that are more relevant for classifying the developer’s perception. Finally, we compare our approach with a state-of-the-art technique. Key findings show that the devised solution has an F-Measure up to 85% and outperforms the baseline approach."

      "Abstract": "In the last few years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have become ubiquitous terms. These powerful techniques have escaped obscurity in academic communities with the recent onslaught of AI \u0026amp; ML tools, frameworks, and libraries that make these techniques accessible to a wider audience of developers. As a result, applying AI \u0026amp; ML to solve existing and emergent problems is an increasingly popular practice. However, little is known about this domain from the software engineering perspective. Many AI \u0026amp; ML tools and applications are open source, and hosted on platforms such as GitHub that provide rich tools for large-scale distributed software development. Despite widespread use and popularity, these repositories have never been examined as a community to identify unique properties, development patterns, and trends. \nIn this paper, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of AI \u0026amp; ML Tool (700) and Application (4,524) repositories hosted on GitHub to develop such a characterization. To compare this community to the wider population of repositories, we compare our analyses to 4,101 unrelated repositories. We enhance this characterization with an elaborate study of developer workflow that measures collaboration and autonomy within a repository. We’ve captured key insights of this community’s 10 year history such as it’s primary language (Python) and most popular repositories (Tensorflow, Tesseract). Our findings show the AI \u0026amp; ML community has unique characteristics that should be accounted for in future research."

      "Abstract": "In this work we apply anomaly detection to source code and bytecode to facilitate development of a programming language and its compiler. We define anomaly as a code fragment that is different from typical code written in a particular programming language. Identifying such code fragments is beneficial to both language developers and end users, since anomalies may indicate potential issues with the compiler or with runtime performance. Moreover, anomalies could correspond to problems in language design. For this study, we choose Kotlin as the target programming language. We outline and discuss approaches to obtaining vector representations of source code and bytecode and to detection of anomalies across vectorized code snippets. The paper presents a method that aims to detect two types of anomalies: syntax tree anomalies and so-called compiler-induced anomalies that arise only in the compiled bytecode. We describe several experiments that employ different combinations of vectorizaton and anomaly detection techniques, and discuss types of detected anomalies and their usefulness for language developers. We demonstrate that the extracted anomalies and the underlying extraction technique provide additional value for language development."

      "Abstract": "Programming screencasts can be a rich source of documentation for developers, as they often contain step-by-step explanations of source code, programming concepts, errors, etc. Despite the availability of millions of such videos, the rich information available in programming screencasts, and especially the source code being displayed on screen is not easy to find, search, or reuse by programmers. Recent research has identified this challenge and has proposed solutions that identify and extract source code from video tutorials in order to make it readily available to developers or to other processing tools. A crucial component in this line of work is the choice of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine used to identify and transcribe the source code shown on screen. Previous work has simply chosen one OCR engine or another, without consideration for the accuracy of these engines on source code recognition. In this paper we aim to address this oversight and present an empirical study on the accuracy of six OCR engines on the extraction of source code from programming screencasts and code images. Our results show that the transcription accuracy varies greatly from one OCR engine to another and that the most widely chosen OCR engine in previous studies is by far not the best choice. We also show how other factors, such as font type and size can impact the results. We conclude by offering guidelines for programming screencast creators on which fonts to use to enable a better OCR recognition of their source code, as well as advice on OCR choice for researchers aiming to analyze source code in screencasts."

      "Abstract": "Research in Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is research involving human subjects, as the repositories usually contain data about developers’ interactions with the repositories. Therefore, any research in the area needs to consider the ethics implications of the intended activity before starting. This paper presents a discussion of the ethics implications of MSR research, using the mining challenges from the years 2010 to 2019 as a case study. It highlights problems that one may encounter in creating such datasets, and discusses ethics challenges that may be encountered when using existing datasets. An analysis of 102 accepted papers to the Mining Challenge Track suggests that none had an explicit discussion of ethics considerations. Whilst this does not necessarily mean ethics were not considered, the sparsity of discussion leads us to suggest that the MSR community should at least increase awareness by openly discussing ethicas considerations."

      "Abstract": "Central to software composition analysis is a database of vulnerabilities of open-source libraries. Security researchers curate this database from various data sources, including bug tracking systems, commits, and mailing lists. In this article, we report the design and implementation of a machine learning system to help the curation by automatically predicting the vulnerability-relatedness of each data item. It supports a complete pipeline from data collection, model training and prediction, to the validation of new models before deployment. It is executed iteratively to generate better models as new input data become available. It is enhanced by self-training to significantly and automatically increase the size of the training dataset, opportunistically maximizing the improvement in the models’ quality at each iteration. We devised new “deployment stability” metric to evaluate the quality of the new models before deployment into production. We experimentally evaluate the improvement in the performance of the models in one iteration, with 27.59% maximum PR AUC improvements. Ours is the first of such study across a variety of data sources. We discover that the addition of the features of the corresponding commits to the features of issues/pull requests improve the precision for the recall values that matter. We demonstrate the effectiveness of self-training alone, with 10.50% PR AUC improvement, and we discover that there is no uniform ordering of word2vec parameters sensitivity across data sources. We show how the deployment stability metric helped to discover an error."

      "Abstract": "Software chatbots are flourishing these days in different domains and fields due to their benefits in saving costs, time, and effort. This is due to their capability of allowing users to communicate and control different services easily through natural language. The chatbot development requires special expertise (e.g., machine learning and conversation design) that differ from the traditional software systems. However, to date, the challenges that chatbot developers face remain fuzzy and unclear as most of the studies focused on proposing chatbots to perform particular tasks. \nTherefore, in this paper, we investigate Q\u0026amp;A website to provide insights on the topics that chatbot developers are interested and the challenges they face. In particular, we leverage topic modeling to understand the topics that are being discussed by chatbot developers on Stack Overflow. Then, we examine the popularity and difficulty of those topics. Our results show that most of the chatbot developers are using Stack Overflow to ask about implementation guidelines. The developers discuss 12 chatbot topics (e.g., User Interface) that are grouped into five categories. Most of the posts belong to chatbot development, integration, and the natural language understanding model categories. On the other hand, we find that developers consider the posts of building and integrating chatbots topics more helpful compared to other topics. Moreover, they are facing challenges in the training of the chatbot’s model. We believe that our study guides future research to propose techniques and tools to help the community at its early stages to overcome the most popular and difficult topics that practitioners face when developing chatbots."

      "Abstract": "Models, as the main artifact in model-driven engineering, have been extensively used for goals such as code generation and verification in the area of embedded systems modeling. One of the most popular behavioral modeling techniques is state machine. Many state machine modeling guidelines recommend that a state machine should have more than one state in order to be meaningful. However, single-state state machines (SSSMs) violating this recommendation have been used in modeling cases reported in the literature. In this paper, we investigate the use of SSSMs by studying their prevalence and roles in the domain of embedded systems, as well as why developers use them and what advantages and disadvantages developers perceive. We employ the sequential explanatory strategy to study 1500 state machines from 26 components at a large company producing embedded systems. We observe that 25 out of 26 components contain SSSMs, making up 25.3% of the model base. To understand the reasons for this extensive usage we conduct a series of interviews followed by a grounded theory building. The results suggest that SSSMs are used to interface with the existing code base, to deal with tool limitations, to facilitate maintenance and to ease verification. Based on our results, we provide implications to modeling tool builders. Furthermore, we formulate two hypotheses about the effectiveness of SSSMs as well as the impacts of SSSMs on development, maintenance and verification."

      "Abstract": "While some promote method chaining as a good practice for improving code readability, others refer to it as a bad practice that worsens code quality. In this paper, we first investigate whether method chaining is a programming style accepted by real-world programmers. To answer this question, we collected 2,814 Java repositories on GitHub and analyzed historical trends in the frequency of method chaining. The results of our analysis revealed the increasing use of method chaining; 23.1% of method invocations were part of method chains in 2018, whereas only 16.0% were such invocations in 2010. We then explore language features that are helpful to the method-chaining style but have not been supported yet in Java. For this aim, we conducted manual inspections of method chains that are randomly sampled from the collected repositories. We also estimated how effective they are to encourage the method-chaining style if they are adopted in Java."

In this paper we build on the idea that if a particular fragment of code is changed too often, it could be caused by some technical or architectural issues, therefore, this fragment requires additional attention from developers. Most teams nowadays use version control systems to track changes in their code and organize cooperation between developers. We propose to use data from version control systems to track the number of changes for each method in a project for a selected time period and display this information within the IDE’s code editor. The paper describes such a tool built as a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA."

We evaluate the performance of SE-specific tools in a cross-platform setting, i.e., on a test set collected from data sources different from the one used for training. We find that (i) the lexicon-based tools outperform the supervised approaches retrained in a cross-platform setting and (ii) retraining can be beneficial in within-platform settings in the presence of robust gold standard datasets, even using a minimal training set. Based on our empirical findings, we derive guidelines for reliable use of sentiment analysis tools in software engineering."

      "Abstract": "Security is an increasing concern in software development. Developer Question and Answer (Q\u0026amp;A) websites provide a large amount of security discussion. Existing studies have used human-defined rules to mine security discussions, but these works still miss many posts, which may lead to an incomplete analysis of the security practices reported on Q\u0026amp;A websites. Traditional supervised Machine Learning methods can automate the mining process; however, the required negative (non-security) class is too expensive to obtain. We propose a novel learning framework, PUMiner, to automatically mine security posts from Q\u0026amp;A websites. PUMiner builds a context-aware embedding model to extract features of the posts, and then develops a two-stage PU model to identify security content using the labelled Positive and Unlabelled posts. We evaluate PUMiner on more than 17.2 million posts on Stack Overflow and 52,611 posts on Security StackExchange. We show that PUMiner is effective with the validation performance of at least 85% across all model configurations. Moreover, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of PUMiner is 0.906 points, 148% and 10.4% higher than one-class SVM, positive-similarity filtering, and one-stage PU models on unseen testing posts, respectively. PUMiner also performs well with an MCC of 0.745 for scenarios where string matching totally fails. Even when the ratio of the labelled positive posts to the unlabelled ones is only 1:100, PUMiner still achieves a strong MCC of 0.65, which is 160% better than fully-supervised learning. Using PUMiner, we provide the largest and up-to-date security content on Q\u0026amp;A websites for practitioners and researchers."

      "Abstract": "Understanding the nature of regular expression (regex) issues is important to tackle practical issues developers face in regular expression usage. Knowledge about the nature and frequency of various types of regular expression issues, such as those related to performance, API misuse, and code smells, for example, can guide testing, inform documentation writers, and motivate refactoring efforts. However, beyond ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service), little is known about to what extent regular expression issues affect software development and how these issues are addressed in practice. \nThis paper presents a comprehensive empirical study of 350 merged regex-related pull requests (PRs) from Apache, Mozilla, Facebook, and Google GitHub repositories. Through classifying the root causes and manifestations of those bugs, we show that incorrect regular expression behavior is the dominant root cause of regular expression bugs (46.3%). The remaining root causes are incorrect API usage (9.3%) and other code issues that require regular expression changes in the fix (29.5%). By studying the code changes of regex-related pull requests, we observe that fixing regular expression bugs is nontrivial as it takes more time and more lines of code to fix them compared to the general pull requests. The results of this study contribute to a broader understanding of the practical problems faced by developers when using regular expressions."

We have divided the bug localization tools in our evaluation into the following three generations: (1) The first-generation tools, now almost a decade old, are based purely on Bag-of-Words (BoW) modeling of software libraries; (2) The second-generation tools that augment BoW-based modeling with two additional pieces of information: historical data, such as change history, and structured information such as class names, method names, etc. And, (3) The most recent third-generation tools that additionally also exploit proximity, order, and semantic relationships between the terms. It is important to realize that the original authors of all these three generations of tools tested them on relatively small-sized datasets that typically consisted no more than a few thousand bug reports. And, for an even more serious shortcoming, those evaluations only involved Java code libraries. The goal of the present paper is to present a comprehensive large-scale evaluation of all three generations of bug-localization tools with code libraries in multiple languages. Our study involves over 20,000 bug reports drawn from a diverse collection of Java, C/C++, and Python projects."

In this pa- per we investigate which artifacts constitute software by analyzing 23 715 repositories from Github, we categorize the found artifacts into high-level categories, such as, code, data, and documentation (and into 19 more concrete categories) and we can confirm the notion of others that software is more than just source code or programs, for which the term is often used synonymously. With this work we provide an empirical study of more than 13 million artifacts, we provide a taxonomy of artifact categories, and we can conclude that software most often consists of variously distributed amounts of code in different forms, such as, source code, binary code, scripts, etc., data, such as, configuration files, images, databases, etc., and documentation, such as user documentation, licenses, etc."

      "Abstract": "The great influence of Bitcoin has promoted the rapid development of blockchain-based digital currencies, especially the altcoins, since 2013. However, most altcoins share similar source codes, resulting in concerns about code innovations. In this paper, an empirical study on existing altcoins is carried out to offer a thorough understanding of various aspects associated with altcoin innovations. Firstly, we construct the dataset of altcoins, including source code repositories, GitHub fork relations, and market capitalizations (cap). Then, we analyze the altcoin innovations from the perspective of source code similarities. The results demonstrate that more than 85% of altcoin repositories present high code similarities. Next, a temporal clustering algorithm is proposed to mine the inheritance relationship among various altcoins. The family pedigrees of altcoin are constructed, in which the altcoin presents similar evolution features as biology, such as power-law in family size, variety in family evolution, etc. Finally, we investigate the correlation between code innovations and market capitalization. Although we fail to predict the price of altcoins based on their code similarities, the results show that altcoins with higher innovations reflect better market prospects."

      "Abstract": "Mining Software Repositories (MSR) has recently seen a focus toward ultra-large-scale datasets. Several tools exist to support these efforts, such as the Boa language and infrastructure. While Boa has seen extensive use, in its current form it is not always possible to perform the entire analysis task within the infrastructure, often requiring some post-processing in another language. This limits end-to-end reproducibility and limits sharing/re-use of MSR queries. To address this problem, we use the notion of views from the relational database field and designed a query language and runtime infrastructure extension for Boa that we call materialized views. Materialized views provide output reuse to Boa users, so that the results of prior Boa queries can be easily reused by others. This allows for computing results not previously possible within Boa and provides for increased sharing and reuse of MSR queries. To evaluate views, we performed two partial reproductions of prior MSR studies utilizing Boa’s dataset and infrastructure with Boa and compare our results to the prior studies. This shows the usability of the new infrastructure, allowing analyses in Boa that were not previously possible as well as providing a previously hand created gold dataset for identifier splitting as a reusable view for other MSR researchers. We also verified the caching behavior using the queries from one of the case studies. The results show that caching works as expected and can drastically improve the runtime performance."

      "Abstract": "The notion of software “fork” has been shifting over time from the (negative) phenomenon of community disagreements that result in the creation of separate development lines and ultimately software products, to the (positive) practice of using distributed version control system (VCS) repositories to collaboratively improve a single software product without stepping on each others toes in the interim. Either way, VCS repositories involved in a fork share parts of a common development history. \nHistorically, studies of software forks have relied on hosting platform metadata, and most notably GitHub, as the source of truth for what constitutes a fork. However, these “forge forks” can only identify as forks repositories that have been created on the platform, e.g., by clicking the “fork” button on the GitHub user interface. The increase in popularity of more distributed code hosting platforms (e.g., GitLab) and the habits of significant development communities (e.g., the Linux kernel one, which is not primarily hosted on any single centralized platform) call into question the reliability of trusting hosting platforms to determine what a fork is. Doing so might introduce selection and methodological biases in empirical studies. \nIn this article we explore various definitions of “software forks”, trying to capture the various forking workflows that exist in the real world. We quantify the differences in how many repositories would be identified as forks on GitHub according to the various definitions, confirming that a significant number would be overlooked when only considering “forge forks”. We study the structure of fork networks, observing how their size is affected by the proposed definitions and discuss the potential impacts of these results on empirical research."

      "Abstract": "Authentication is a critical security feature for confirming the identity of a system’s users, typically implemented with help from frameworks like Spring Security. It’s important to robustly test complex security features, and unit testing is an effective technique for verifying the correctness of the fine-grained behaviors of a feature. Unfortunately, resources to help developers unit test security features are limited. Most guides focus on black box or penetration testing, tests produced by existing test generation tools are difficult to maintain, and recommendation solutions usually focus on prioritization and selection of existing tests. These solutions are not applicable to developers writing new unit tests, or who want to use metrics other than coverage to track what has been tested. \nIn this paper, we address these issues using a grounded theory-based approach to identify common test cases for token authentication by analyzing 481 JUnit tests exercising Spring Security-based authentication implementations from 53 open source Java projects. The outcome of this study is a unit testing guide organized as a catalog of 52 test cases for token authentication, representing unique combinations of 17 scenarios, 40 conditions, and 30 expected outcomes learned from the data set in our analysis. We supplement the test guide with common test smells to avoid. To verify the accuracy and usefulness of our testing guide, we sought feedback from selected developers, some of whom authored unit tests in our dataset."

      "Abstract": "Self-admitted technical debt (SATD) is a particular case of Technical Debt (TD) where developers explicitly acknowledge their sub-optimal implementation decisions. Previous studies mine SATD by searching for specific TD-related terms in source code comments. By contrast, in this paper we argue that developers can admit technical debt by other means, e.g., by creating issues in tracking systems and labelling them as referring to TD. We refer to this type of SATD as issue-based SATD or just SATD-I. We study a sample of 286 SATD-I instances collected from five open source projects, including Microsoft Visual Studio and GitLab Community Edition. We show that only 29% of the studied SATD-I instances can be tracked to source code comments. We also show that SATD-I issues take more time to be closed, compared to other issues, although they are not more complex in terms of code churn. Besides, in 45% of the studied issues TD was introduced to ship earlier, and in almost 60% it refers to Design flaws. Finally, we report that most developers pay SATD-I to reduce its costs or interests (66%). Our findings suggest that there is space for designing novel tools to support technical debt management, particularly tools that encourage developers to create and label issues containing TD concerns."

      "Abstract": "Flaky tests are tests whose outcomes are non-deterministic. Despite the recent research activity on this topic, no effort has been made on understanding the vocabulary of flaky tests (e.g., networking or concurrency identifiers). This work proposes to automatically classify tests as flaky or not. Classification of flaky tests is important,for example, to detect the introduction of flaky test and to search for flaky tests after they are introduced in test suites. We evaluated performance of various machine learning algorithms to solve this problem. We constructed a dataset of flaky and non-flaky tests by running more than 50k test cases, 100 times each. We then used machine learning techniques on the resulting data set to predict which tests are flaky from their source. Based on features, such as counting stemmed tokens extracted from source code identifiers, we achieved an F-measure of 0.95 for the identification of flaky tests. The best performance was achieved when using Random Forest and Support Vector Machines for the prediction. In terms of the code identifiers that are most strongly associated with test flakiness, we noted that job, action, and services are commonly associated with flaky tests."

Prior studies have evaluated the rate at which builds in large organizations fail. However, little is known about the frequency and fix effort of failures that occur in Docker builds of open-source projects. This paper provides a first attempt to present a preliminary study on 857,086 Docker builds from 3,828 open-source projects hosted on GitHub. Using the Docker builds data, we measure the frequency of broken builds and report their fix time. Furthermore, we explore the evolution of Docker build failures across time. Our findings help to characterize and understand Docker build failures and motivate the need for collecting more empirical evidence."

      "Abstract": "Bug tracking systems (BTS) are widely used in software projects. An important task in such systems consists in identifying duplicate bug reports, i.e., distinct reports related to the same software issue. For several reasons, reporting bugs that have already been reported is quite frequent, making their manual triage unpractical in large BTSs. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning network based on soft-attention alignment to improve duplicate bug report detec- tion. Our model can dynamically focus on distinct segments of the bug reports during the generation of report representations. This architecture is more flexible than previous approaches that compute report representations without or with limited data exchange. We evaluate our model on four well-known datasets derived from BTSs of four popular open-source projects. Our experimental evaluation relies on a ranking-based methodology, which is more adherent to real world scenarios than decision-making methodologies used in many previous works. It demonstrates that our model outperforms state-of-the-art systems and strong baselines in different scenarios. Finally, we also report on ablation studies to confirm our hypothesis that a more flexible architecture is helpful for extracting relevant information from bug reports."

In this study, we compile an extensive corpus of popular Java projects from GitHub, search it for code clones and perform an original analysis of possible code borrowing and license violations on the level of code fragments. We chose Java as a language because of its popularity in industry, where the plagiarism problem is especially relevant because of possible legal action. We analyze and discuss distribution of 95 different discovered and manually evaluated licenses in files and projects, differences in the licensing of files, distribution of potential code borrowing between licenses, various types of possible license violations, most violated licenses, etc. Studying possible license violations in specific blocks of code, we have discovered that 29.6% of them might be involved in potential code borrowing and 9.4% of them could potentially violate original licenses."

      "Abstract": "Automatic source code analysis in key areas of software engineering, such as code security, can benefit from Machine Learning (ML). However, many standard ML approaches require a numeric representation of data and cannot be applied directly to source code. Thus, to enable ML, we need to embed source code into numeric feature vectors while maintaining the semantics of the code as much as possible. code2vec is a recently released embedding approach that uses the proxy task of method name prediction to map Java methods to feature vectors. However, experimentation with code2vec shows that it learns to rely on variable names for prediction, causing it to be easily fooled by typos or adversarial attacks. Moreover, it is only able to embed individual Java methods and cannot embed an entire collection of methods such as those present in a typical Java class, making it difficult to perform predictions at the class level (e.g., for the identification of malicious Java classes). Both shortcomings are addressed in the research presented in this paper. We investigate the effect of obfuscating variable names during training of a code2vec model to force it to rely on the structure of the code rather than specific names and consider a simple approach to creating class-level embeddings by aggregating sets of method embeddings. Our results, obtained on a challenging new collection of source-code classification problems, indicate that obfuscating variable names produces an embedding model that is both impervious to variable naming and more accurately reflects code semantics. The datasets, models, and code are shared for further ML research on source code."

      "Abstract": "Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers frequently integrate code into a common codebase. After the code is integrated, the CI server runs a test suite and other tools to produce a set of reports (e.g., output of linters and tests). If the result of a CI test run is unexpected, developers have the option to manually restart the build, re-running the same test suite on the same code; this can reveal build flakiness, if the restarted build outcome differs from the original build. In this study, we analyze restarted builds, flaky builds, and their impact on the development workflow. We observe that developers restart at least 1.72% of builds, amounting to 56,522 restarted builds in our Travis CI dataset. We observe that more mature and more complex projects are more likely to include restarted builds. The restarted builds are mostly builds that are initially failing due to a test, network problem, or a Travis CI limitations such as execution timeout. Finally, we observe that restarted builds have a major impact on development workflow. Indeed, in 54.42% of the restarted builds, the developers analyze and restart a build within an hour of the initial failure. This suggests that developers wait for CI results, interrupting their workflow to address the issue. Restarted builds also slow down the merging of pull requests by a factor of three, bringing median merging time from 16h to 48h."

Software dependencies are constantly evolving with newly added features and patches that fix bugs in older versions. However, updating dependencies could introduce new bugs or break backward compatibility. In this work, we propose a technique to detect breakage-inducing versions of third-party dependencies. The key insight behind our approach is to leverage the automated test suites of other projects that depend upon the same dependency to test newly released versions. We conjecture that this crowd-based approach will help to detect breakage-inducing versions because it broadens the set of realistic usage scenarios to which a package version has been exposed. To evaluate our conjecture, we perform an empirical study of 391,553 npm packages. We use the dependency network from these packages to identify candidate tests of third-party packages. Moreover, to evaluate our proposed technique, we mine the history of this dependency network to identify ten breakage-inducing versions. We find that our proposed technique can detect six of the ten studied breakage-inducing versions. Our findings can help developers to make more informed decisions when they update their dependencies."

Even though test smell detection tools exist, how to rank the severity of the detected smells is an open research topic. In this work, we aim at investigating the severity rating for four test smells and investigate their perceived impact on test suite maintainability by the developers. To accomplish this, we first analyzed some 1,500 open-source projects to elicit severity thresholds for commonly found test smells. Then, we conducted a study with developers to evaluate our thresholds. We found that (1) current detection rules for certain test smells are considered as too strict by the developers and (2) our newly defined severity thresholds are in line with the participants’ perception of how test smells have an impact on the maintainability of a test suite."

In this paper we present BARRAGE, a novel framework for building polyglot distributed repository mining programs. We demonstrate how BARRAGE offers delegation of mining jobs to remote workers and can cache their results, how such workers are able to implement advanced behaviors like load balancing and rejecting jobs they either cannot perform or would execute sub-optimally, and how workers of the same analysis program can be written in different programing languages like Java and Python, executing only relevant parts of the program described in that language."

In this paper, we develop a tool, SoftMon, that can compare the codebases of two separate applications and pinpoint the exact set of functions that are disproportionately responsible for differences in performance. Our tool uses machine learning and NLP techniques to analyze why a given open-source application has a lower performance as compared to its peers, design bespoke applications that can incorporate specific innovations (identified by SoftMon) in competing applications, and diagnose performance bugs. In this paper, we compare a wide variety of large open-source programs such as image editors, audio players, text editors, PDF readers, mail clients and even full-fledged operating systems (OSs). In all cases, our tool was able to pinpoint a set of at the most 10-15 functions that are responsible for the differences within 200 seconds. A subsequent manual analysis assisted by our Graph Visualization Engine helps us find the reasons. We were able to validate most of the reasons by correlating them with subsequent observations made by developers or from extant technical literature. The manual phase of our analysis is limited to 30 minutes (tested with human subjects)."

      "Abstract": "The software engineering practice of automated testing helps programmers find defects earlier during development. With growing software projects and longer-running test suites, frequency and immediacy of feedback decline, thereby making defects harder to repair. Regression test prioritization (RTP) is concerned with running relevant tests earlier to lower the costs of defect localization and to improve feedback. \nFinding representative data to evaluate RTP techniques is non-trivial, as most software is published without failing tests. In this work, we systematically survey a wide range of RTP literature regarding whether their dataset uses real or synthetic defects or tests, whether they are publicly available, and whether datasets are reused. We observed that some datasets are reused, however, many projects study only few projects and these rarely resemble real-world development activity. \nIn light of these threats to ecological validity, we describe the construction and characteristics of a new dataset based on 20 open-source Java programs. \nOur dataset allows researchers to evaluate prioritization heuristics based on version control meta-data, source code, and test results from fine-grained, automated builds over 9 years of development history. We provide reproducible baselines for initial comparisons and make all data publicly available. \nWe see this as a step towards better reproducibility, ecological validity, and long-term availability of studied software in the field of test prioritization."

Due to the non-trivial costs of manually creating and maintaining links,many researchers have proposed automated approaches based on information retrieval techniques. However, many globally distributed software projects produce software artifacts written in two or more languages. The use of intermingled languages reduces the efficacy of automated tracing solutions. In this paper, we first analyze and dis-cuss patterns of intermingled language use across multiple projects,and then evaluate several different tracing algorithms including the Vector Space Model (VSM), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), Latent Direchlet Allocation (LDA), and various models that combine mono-and cross-lingual word embeddings with the Generative Vector Space Model (GVSM). Based on an analysis of 14 Chinese-English projects, our results show that best performance is achieved using mono-lingual word embeddings integrated into GVSM with machine translation as a preprocessing step."

      "Abstract": "Software documentation largely consists of short, natural language summaries of the subroutines in the software. These summaries help programmers quickly understand what a subroutine does without having to read the source code him or herself. The task of writing these descriptions is called “source code summarization” and has been a target of research for several years. Recently, AI-based approaches have superseded older, heuristic-based approaches. Yet, to date these AI-based approaches assume that all the content needed to predict summaries is inside subroutine itself. This assumption limits performance because many subroutines cannot be understood without surrounding context. In this paper, we present an approach that models the file context of subroutines (i.e. other subroutines in the same file) and uses an attention mechanism to find words and concepts to use in summaries. We show in an experiment that our approach extends and improves several recent baselines."

      "Abstract": "Despite all of the power that machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) models bring to applications, much of AI development is currently a fairly ad hoc process. Software engineering and AI development share many of the same languages and tools, but AI development as an engineering practice is still in early stages. Mining software repositories of AI models enables insight into the current state of AI development. However, much of the relevant metadata around models are not easily extractable directly from repositories and require deduction or domain knowledge. This paper presents a library called AIMMX that enables simplified AI Model Metadata eXtraction from software repositories. The extractors have five modules for extracting AI model-specific metadata: model name, associated datasets, references, AI frameworks used, and model domain. We evaluated AIMMX against 7,998 open source models from three sources: model zoos, arXiv AI papers, and state-of-the-art AI papers. AIMMX extracted metadata with 87% precision and 83% recall. As preliminary examples of how AI model metadata extraction enables studies and tools to advance engineering support for AI development, this paper presents an exploratory analysis for data and method reproducibility over the models in the evaluation dataset and a catalog tool for discovering and managing models. Our analysis suggests that while data reproducibility may be relatively poor with 42% of models in our sample citing their datasets, method reproducibility is more common at 72% of models in our sample, particularly state-of-the-art models. Our collected models are searchable in a catalog that uses existing metadata to enable advanced discovery features for efficiently finding models."

      "Abstract": "Context: The Heartbleed vulnerability brought OpenSSL to interna- tional attention in 2014. The almost moribund project was a key security component in public web servers and over a billion mobile devices. This vulnerability led to new investments in OpenSSL. \nObjective: The goal of this study is to determine how the Heart- bleed vulnerability changed the software evolution of OpenSSL. We study changes in vulnerabilities, code quality, project activity, and software engineering practices. \nMethod: We use a mixed methods approach, collecting multiple types of quantitative data and qualitative data from web sites and interviews with project members. We use regression discontinuity analysis to determine changes in levels and slopes of code and project activity metrics resulting from Heartbleed. \nResults: The OpenSSL project made tremendous improvements to code quality and security after Heartbleed. By the end of 2016, the number of commits per month had tripled, 91 vulnerabilities were found and fixed, code complexity decreased significantly, and OpenSSL obtained a CII best practices badge, certifying its use of good open source development practices. \nConclusions: The OpenSSL project provides a model of how an open source project can adapt and improve after a security event. The evolution of OpenSSL shows that the number of known vulner- abilities is not a useful indicator of project security. A small number of vulnerabilities may simply indicate that a project does not ex- pend much effort to finding vulnerabilities. This study suggests that project activity and CII badge best practices may be better indicators of code quality and security than vulnerability counts."

Data-intensive systems that frequently access databases often suffer from SQL code smells besides the traditional smells. While there have been extensive studies on traditional code smells, recently, there has been a growing interest in SQL code smells. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the prevalence and evolution of SQL code smells in open source, data-intensive systems. We collected 150 projects and examined both traditional and SQL code smells in these projects. Our investigation delivers several important findings. First, SQL code smells are indeed prevalent in data-intensive software systems. Second, SQL code smells have a weak co-occurrence with traditional code smells. Third, SQL code smells have a weaker association with bugs than that of traditional code smells. Fourth, SQL code smells are more likely to be introduced at the beginning of the project lifetime and likely to be left in the code without a fix, compared to traditional code smells. Overall, our results show that SQL code smells are indeed prevalent and persistent in the studied data-intensive software systems. Developers should be aware of these smells and consider detecting and refactoring SQL code smells and traditional code smells separately, using dedicated tools."

      "Abstract": "Social media, especially Twitter, has always been a part of the professional lives of software developers, with prior work reporting on a diversity of usage scenarios, including sharing information, staying current, and promoting one’s work. However, previous studies of Twitter use by software developers are generally restricted to surveys or small samples, and typically lack information about activities of the study subjects (and their outcomes) on other platforms. To enable such future research, in this paper we propose a computational approach to cross-linking users on Twitter and GitHub, the dominant platform for hosting open-source development, revealing 70,428 users active on both. As a preliminary analysis of this dataset, we report on a case study of 800 tweets by open-source developers about GitHub work, combining precise automatic characterization of tweet authors in terms of their relationship to the GitHub items linked in their tweets with a deep qualitative analysis of the tweet contents. We find that developers have very distinct behavioral patterns when including GitHub links in their tweets and these patterns are correlated with the relationship between the tweet author and the repository they link to. Based on this analysis, we hypothesize about what might explain such behavioral differences and what the implications of different tweeting patterns could be for the sustainability of GitHub projects."

      "Abstract": "Background: Some developer activity traditionally performed manually, such as making code commits, opening, managing, or closing issues is increasingly subject to automation in many OSS projects. Specifically, such activity is often performed by tools that react to events or run at specific times. We refer to such automation tools as bots and, in many software mining scenarios related to developer productivity or code quality it is desirable to identify bots in order to separate their actions from actions of individuals. Aim: Find an automated way of identifying bots and code committed by these bots, and to characterize the types of bots based on their activity patterns. Method and Result: We propose BIMAN, a systematic approach to detect bots using author names, commit messages, files modified by the commit, and projects associated with the commits. For our test data, the value for AUC-ROC was 0.9. We also characterized these bots based on the time patterns of their code commits and the types of files modified, and found that they primarily work with documentation files and web pages, and these files are most prevalent in HTML and JavaScript ecosystems. We have compiled a shareable dataset containing detailed information about 461 bots we found (all of whom have more than 1000 commits) and 14,678,222 commits they created."

To address this gap, in this paper we present a novel mining software repositories approach to detect feature flagging open-source projects, based on analyzing the projects’ commit messages. We apply our approach to all open-source GitHub projects, identifying 231,223 candidate feature flagging projects, and manually validating 100. We also report on an initial analysis of feature flags in the validated sample of 100 projects, investigating practices that correlate with shorter flag lifespans (typically desirable to reduce technical debt), such as using the issue tracker and having the flag owner (the developer introducing a flag) also be the one removing it."

      "Abstract": "Deep learning practitioners are often interested in improving their model accuracy rather than the interpretability of their models. As a result, deep learning applications are inherently complex in their structures. They also need to continuously evolve in terms of code changes and model updates. Given these confounding factors, there is a great chance of violating the recommended programming practices by the developers in their deep learning applications. In particular, the code quality might be negatively affected due to their drive for the higher model performance. Unfortunately, the code quality of deep learning applications has rarely been studied to date. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study using 118 open-source software systems from GitHub where we contrast between deep learning-based and traditional systems in terms of their code quality. We have several major findings. First, deep learning applications smell like the traditional ones. However, long lambda expression, long ternary conditional expression, and complex container comprehension smells are frequently found in deep learning projects. That is, the DL code involves more complex or longer expressions than the traditional code does. Second, code smells are found increasing across the releases of deep learning applications. Third, we found that there is a co-existence between code smells and software bugs in the deep learning code, which confirms our conjecture on the degraded code quality in deep learning applications."

      "Abstract": "Refactoring consists of a program transformation applied to improve the internal structure of a program, for instance, by contributing to remove code smells. Developers often apply multiple interrelated refactorings called composite refactoring. Even though composite refactoring is a common practice, an investigation from different points of view on how composite refactoring manifests in practice is missing. Previous empirical studies also neglect how different kinds of composite refactorings affect the removal, prevalence or introduction of smells. To address these matters, we provide a conceptual framework and two heuristics to identify composite refactorings within and across commits. Then, we mined the commit history of 48 GitHub software projects, in which we identified and analyzed 24,911 composite refactorings involving 104,505 single refactorings. Amongst several findings, we observed that most composite refactorings occur in the same commit and have the same refactoring type. We also found that several refactorings are semantically related to each other, which occur in different parts of the system but are still related to the same task. Many smells are introduced in a program due to “incomplete” composite refactorings. Additionally, we found 111 patterns of composite refactorings that frequently introduce or remove certain smell types. They can be used as guidelines for developers to improve their refactoring practices as well as for designers of recommender systems."

      "Abstract": "Code refactorings are of pivotal importance in modern code review. Developers may preserve, revisit, add or undo refactorings through changes’ revisions. Their goal is to certify that the driving intent of a code change is properly achieved. Developers’ intents behind refactorings may vary from pure structural improvement to facilitating feature additions and bug fixes. However, there is little understanding of the refactoring practices performed by developers during the code review process. It is also unclear whether the developers’ intents influence the selection, composition, and evolution of refactorings during the review of a code change. Through mining 1,780 reviewed code changes from 6 systems pertaining to two large open-source communities, we report the first in-depth empirical study on software refactoring during code review. We inspected and classified the developers’ intents behind each code change into 7 distinct categories. By analyzing data generated during the complete reviewing process, we observe: (i) how refactorings are selected, composed and evolved throughout each code change, and (ii) how developers’ intents are related to these decisions. For instance, our analysis shows developers regularly apply non-trivial sequences of refactorings that crosscut multiple code elements (i.e., widely scattered in the program) to support a single feature addition. Moreover, we observed that new developers’ intents commonly emerge during the code review process, influencing how developers select and compose their refactorings to achieve the new and adapted goals. Finally, we provide an enriched dataset that allows researchers to investigate the context and motivations behind refactoring operations during the code review process."

      "Abstract": "User satisfaction is essential for the success of software projects. In fact, even when the budget and the schedule of a project are in control, user dissatisfaction may still lead the project to failure. However, the satisfaction of a user is only part of the success recipe, since a strong competition can also detract users more easily from a software product/service. Users’ churn is the jargon used to denote when a user decides to change from a product/service to those offered by the competitors. In this study, we empirically investigate the relationship between the issues that are present in a software project and the users’ churn. For this purpose, we investigate a new dataset provided by the alternativeto.net platform. Alternativeto.net has a unique feature that allows users to recommend alternatives for a specific software product. The recommendation of alternatives can signal the intention to switch from one software product to another. Through our empirical study, we observe that (i) the intention to change software is tightly associated to the issues that are present in these software; (ii) we can use deep learning models to predict the rate of potential churn that will occur for a software; (iii) the longer the issue takes to be fixed, the higher the chances of users’ churn; and (iv) issues within more general software modules are more likely to be associated with users’ churn. Our study can provide more insights on the prioritization of issues that need to be fixed by considering the probability of users’ churn."

      "Abstract": "Developers continuously update their Android apps to keep up with competitors in the market. Such constant updates do not bother end users, since by default the Android platform automatically pushes the most recent compatible release on the device, unless there are major changes in the list of requested permissions that users have to explicitly grant. The lack of explicit user’s approval for each application update, however, may lead to significant risks for the end user, as the new release may include new subtle behaviors which may be privacy-invasive. The introduction of permission groups in the Android permission model makes this problem even worse: if a user gives a single permission within a group, the application can silently request further permissions in this group with each update—without having to ask the user. \nIn this paper, we explain the threat that permission groups may pose for the privacy of Android users. We run an empirical study on 2,865,553 app releases, and we show that in a representative app store more than ∼17% of apps request new dangerous permissions that the operating system grants without any user’s approval. Our analyses show that apps actually use over 56% of such automatically granted permissions, although most of their descriptions do not explicitly explain for what purposes. Finally, our manual inspection reveals clear abuses of apps that leak sensitive data such as user’s accurate location, list of contacts, history of phone calls, and emails which are protected by permissions that the user never explicitly acknowledges."

This can be used to address known generalizability concerns, and, also, to perform research on open source business software development. Based on the premise that an enterprise’s employees are likely to contribute to a project developed by their organization using the email account provided by it, we mine domain names associated with enterprises from open data sources as well as through white- and blacklisting, and use them through three heuristics to identify 17,252 enterprise GitHub projects. We provide these as a dataset detailing their provenance and properties. A manual evaluation of a dataset sample shows an identification accuracy of 89%. Through an exploratory data analysis we found that projects are staffed by a plurality of enterprise insiders, who appear to be pulling more than their weight, and that in a small percentage of relatively large projects development happens exclusively through enterprise insiders."

As a consequence, on the one side regression testing techniques, e.g., for test suite prioritization or test case selection, capable to handle such large-scale test suites become indispensable; on the other side, as test code exposes own characteristics, specific techniques for its analysis and refactoring are actively sought. We present JTeC, a large-scale dataset of test cases that researchers can use for benchmarking the above techniques or any other type of tool expressly targeting test code. JTeC collects more than 2.5M test classes belonging to 31K+ GitHub projects and summing up to more than 430 Million SLOCs of ready-to-use real-world test code."

      "Abstract": "Software testing is an essential activity to ensure software quality. In a typical use case scenario, developers write a set of test cases and run them periodically on production code to identify defects. However, not all tests have the same fault detection capability. To help developers understand how effective their tests actually are, a number of metrics have been proposed. Among them, mutation coverage represents the high-end test coverage criterion. Artificially created defects are seeded into the production code, creating the so-called mutants. Then, tests are ran against mutants to verify whether they can identify the artificial faults created, hence giving a measure of the effectiveness of tests in catching defects. Despite being so powerful, mutation testing is still too expensive to be used in practice. To address this issue, software repository mining and software analytics can come to rescue. In this hands-on tutorial, participants will be given an introduction on how to develop accurate, reliable, and reproducible analytical models: despite being focused in the context of mutation testing, the insights given will allow participants to model any generic software engineering problem through the use of machine learning solutions. The tutorial will also discuss the common pitfalls associated with analytical techniques. Python, and the Sklearn library in particular, will be the primary technologies employed. Code samples will be available in a public Github repository. \n \n For more information about the problem treated in the tutorial, visit: https://fpalomba.github.io/pdf/Journals/J21.pdf. \n For more information about the Sklearn library, visit: https://scikit-learn.org/. \n For more information about the speaker, visit: https://fpalomba.github.io. \n"

The data contains all the typical information about source code commits (e.g., lines added and removed, message and commit time) and issues (status, severity, votes, and summary). For sentiment analysis, the data has been preprocessed to include emoticons and valence and arousal scores. Linking code repository and issue tracker information, allows inferring timezone information for issue tracker timestamps that don’t have a timezone. To our knowledge this the largest linked data set in size and in project lifetime that isn’t based on GitHub."

      "Abstract": "Program repair is an important but difficult software engineering problem. One way to achieve acceptable performance is to focus on classes of simple bugs, such as bugs with single statement fixes, or that match a small set of bug templates. However, it is very difficult to estimate the recall of repair techniques for simple bugs, as there are no datasets about how often the associated bugs occur in code. To fill this gap, we provide a dataset of 153652 single statement bug-fix changes mined from 1000 popular open-source Java projects, annotated by whether they match any of a set of 16 bug templates, inspired by state-of-the-art program repair techniques. We also administer a repository of Maven dependencies for a subset of 100 projects that use the Maven build system. In an initial analysis, we find that about 33% of the simple bug fixes match the templates, indicating that a remarkable number of single-statement bugs can be repaired with a relatively small set of templates. Further, we find that template fitting bugs appear with a frequency of about one bug per 1600-2500 lines of code (as measured by the size of the project’s latest version). We hope that this dataset will prove a resource both for future work in automatic program repair and also for future studies in empirical software engineering."

This combination allows developers to leverage the strengths of each programming language and reuse existing code. Problem: Software quality is achieved by following good practices and avoiding bad ones. Several catalogs have been formulated to document such practices. However, most of those practices are applied to a single programming language and do not consider the interaction between programming languages. Objective: We previously defined a catalog of bad practices i.e., design smells related to multi-language systems. This paper aims to provide empirical evidence on the relevance of our catalog and its impact on software quality. Method: We analysed 262 snapshots of nine open source projects to detect occurrences of multi-language design smells. We also extracted information about the developers that contributed to those systems. We plan to perform an open and a closed survey targeting software developers in general but also developers that contributed to those systems. We will survey those developers about the prevalence of those smells, their severity and their impact on software quality attributes. From our result, we will provide empirical evidence of the perception and impact of multi-language design smells. We will formulate recommendations for both developers but also researchers interested in improving the quality of multi-language systems."

Build logs are a paramount source of information for developers when debugging into and understanding a build failure. Recently, attempts to partly automate this time-consuming, purely manual activity have come up, such as rule- or information-retrieval-based techniques. We believe that having a common dataset to be able to fairly compare different build log analysis techniques will advance the research area. The width and depth of the LogChunks data set are intended to make it the default benchmark for automated build log analysis techniques. It will ultimately increase our understanding of CI build failures. In this paper, we present LogChunks, a collection of 797 annotated Travis CI build logs from 80 GitHub repositories in 29 programming languages. For each build log, LogChunks contains a manually labeled log part (chunk) describing why the build failed. We externally validated the data set with the developers who caused the original build failure."

      "Abstract": "Due to the rise of social coding platforms like Github, Gitlab, Bit-bucket, the mechanism of contributing to open source projects changed drastically. One of the features of this modern social cod-ing platforms is forking an existing repository to have a personal copy and enable further contribution or independent development.To identify forks of a repository, we have to get help from the social coding platforms. However, due to the development of Software Heritage Graph Dataset(SWHGD), we can access multiple social coding platforms project in a single dataset. Forked repositories share com-mon commits which can be used to identify cross-platform forks and forks in the same platform in a larger scale. So, in this paper we have proposed an approach to identify forks from SWHGD[7,8] dataset and then analyzed detected cross-platform forks to know the motives behind forking. To evaluate our technique we have used 10 subject systems from Github and retrieved in total68938 fork repositories of them, 97 of which are hosted in Gitlab.Finally, we manually investigated the motives behind the forking and found some features like mirroring, Continuous Integration of Gitlab motivated some forks to be in Gitlab from Github."

Therefore, research on understanding code review and on how to improve reviewers performance is paramount. \nObjective: We aim to test whether there is an effect of a guidance approach on review effectiveness and efficiency. This relationship is expected to work through lowering the cognitive load of the task; therefore, we analyze the mediation relationship as well. \nMethod: To test our hypotheses, we employ an experimental design where professional developers with little review experience have to perform three code review tasks. We use three conditions: no guidance, a checklist, and an explicit review strategy. Furthermore, we measure the reviewersï¿½ cognitive load. \nLimitations: The main limitations of this study concern the specific cohort of participants, the mono-operation bias for the guidance conditions, and the generalizability to other changes and defects.\""

      "Abstract": "Team communication is essential for the development of modern software systems. For distributed software development teams, such as those found in many open source projects, this communication usually takes place using electronic tools. Among these, modern chat platforms such as Gitter are becoming the de facto choice for many software projects due to their advanced features geared towards software development and effective team communication. Gitter channels contain numerous messages exchanged by developers regarding the state of the project, issues and features of the system, team logistics, etc. These messages can contain important information to researchers studying open source software systems, developers new to a particular project and trying to get familiar with the software, etc. Therefore, uncovering what developers are communicating about through Gitter is an essential first step towards successfully understanding and leveraging this information. We present a new dataset, called GitterCom, which is meant to enable research in this direction and represents the largest manually labeled and curated dataset of Gitter developer messages. The dataset is comprised of 10,000 Gitter messages collected from 10 Gitter communities associated with the development of open source software systems. Each message was manually annotated and verified by two of the authors, capturing the purpose of the communication expressed by the message. While the dataset has not yet been used in any publication, we discuss how it can enable interesting research opportunities in the field."

      "Abstract": "The amount of Android apps available for download is constantly increasing, exerting a continuous pressure on developers to publish outstanding apps. Google Play (GP) is the default distribution channel for Android apps, which provides mobile app users with metrics to identify and report apps quality such as rating, amount of downloads, previous users comments, etc. In addition to those metrics, GP presents a set of top charts that highlight the outstanding apps in different categories. Both metrics and top app charts help developers to identify whether their development decisions are well valued by the community. Therefore, app presence in these top charts is a valuable information when understanding the features of top-apps. In this paper we present Hall-of-Apps, a dataset containing top charts’ apps metadata extracted (weekly) from GP, for 4 different countries, during 30 weeks. The data is presented as (i) raw HTML files, (ii) a MongoDB database with all the information contained in app’s HTML files (e.g., app description, category, general rating, etc.), and (iii) data visualizations built with the D3.js framework.

      "Abstract": "Different from traditional software development, there is little information about the software-engineering process and techniques in video-game development. One popular way to share knowledge among the video-game developers’ community is the publishing of postmortems, which are documents summarizing what happened during the video-game development project. However, these documents are written without formal structure and often providing disparate information. Through this paper, we provide developers and researchers with grounded dataset describing software-engineering problems in video-game development extracted from postmortems. We created the dataset using an iterative method through which we manually coded more than 200 postmortems spanning 20 years (1998 to 2018) and extracted 1,035 problems related to software engineering while maintaining traceability links to the postmortems. We grouped the problems in 20 different types. This dataset is useful to understand the problems faced by developers during video-game development, providing researchers and practitioners a starting point to study video-game development in the context of software engineering."

      "Abstract": "The data collected from open source projects provide means to model large software ecosystems, but often suffer from data quality issues, specifically, multiple author identification strings in code commits might actually be associated with one developer. While many methods have been proposed for addressing this problem, they are either heuristics requiring manual tweaking, or require too much calculation time to do pairwise comparisons for 38M author IDs in, for example, the World of Code collection. In this paper, we propose a method that finds all author IDs belonging to a single developer in this entire dataset, and share the list of all author IDs that were found to have aliases. To do this, we first create blocks of potentially connected author IDs and then use a machine learning model to predict which of these potentially related IDs belong to the same developer. We processed around 38 million author IDs and found around 14.8 million IDs to have an alias, which belong to 5.4 million different developers, with the median number of aliases being 2 per developer. This dataset can be used to create more accurate models of developer behaviour at the entire OSS ecosystem level and can be used to provide a service to rapidly resolve new author IDs."

Little is known about the intrinsic structure of the entire corpus of publicly available VCS as an interconnected graph. Understanding its structure is needed to determine the best approach to analyze it in full and to avoid methodological pitfalls when doing so. \nObjective. We intend to determine the most salient network topology properties of public software development history as captured by VCS. We will explore: degree distributions, determining whether they are scale-free or not; distribution of connect component sizes; distribution of shortest path lengths. \nMethod. We will use Software Heritageï¿½which is the largest corpus of public VCS dataï¿½compress it using webgraph compression techniques, and analyze it in-memory using classic graph algorithms. Analyses will be performed both on the full graph and on relevant subgraphs. \nLimitations. The study is exploratory in nature; as such no hypotheses on the findings is stated at this time. Chosen graph algorithms are expected to scale to the corpus size, but it will need to be confirmed experimentally. External validity will depend on how representative Software Heritage is of the software commons."

The graph was created by filtering out more than 30 hand-picked and 2.3 million pattern-matched clumping projects. Projects that introduced unwanted clumping were identified by repeatedly visualizing shortest path distances between unrelated important projects. Our dataset identified 30 thousand duplicate projects in an existing popular reference dataset of 1.8 million projects. An evaluation of our dataset against another created independently with different methods found a significant overlap, but also differences attributed to the operational definition of what projects are considered as related.\u0026nbsp;"

Although the level of awareness of security issues is often high, practical experiences show that neither preventive actions nor reactions to possible issues are always addressed properly in reality. By analyzing large quantities of commits in the open-source communities, typical security-related activities can be categorized, as well as we can explore language peculiarities to learn and improve our security management processes and practices. With the help of the Software Heritage Graph Dataset, we investigated the commits of two of the most popular script language - Python and JavaScript - projects collected from public repositories and identified those that might refer to security-related changes, vulnerability fixes in particular. On the one hand, we identified the types of security issues (in terms of CWE groups) referred to in commit messages and compared their numbers within the two communities. On the other hand, we examined the average time elapsing between the publish date of a security issue and the first reference to it in a commit. We found that there is a large intersection in the issue types addressed by the two communities, but most prevalent issues are specific to a language. Moreover, neither the JavaScript nor the Python community reacts very fast to appearing security issues.”"

The structure of these latent teams has a significant impact on software quality, with development teams structure somewhat reﬂected in the way developers communicate and contribute in the subsystems of a system. Therefore, in order to study socio-technical interactions as well as the software evolution dynamics of open source systems, in this paper, we present a novel dataset, gathered from 20 open source projects, which report the developers’ activities in the scope of commits and issues at the level of subsystems. Thus, the new, generated dataset comprises of emerging and explicit links among developers, commits, issues, and source code artifacts, with data grouped around the subsystems point of view, which can be used to better study the system dynamics behind the extracted socio-technical interactions."

      "Abstract": "In order to understand the state and evolution of the entirety of open source software we need to get a handle on the set of distinct software projects. Most of open source projects presently utilize Git, which is a distributed version control system allowing easy creation of clones and resulting in numerous repositories that are almost entirely based on some parent repository from which they were cloned. Git commits are based on Merkle Tree and two commits are highly unlikely to be produced independently. Shared commits, therefore, appear like an excellent way to group cloned repositories and obtain an accurate map for such repositories. We use World of Code infrastructure containing approximately 2B commits and 100M repositories to create and share such a map. We discover that the largest group contains almost 14M repositories most of which are unrelated to each other. As it turns out, the developers can push git object to an arbitrary repository or pull objects from unrelated repositories, thus linking unrelated repositories. To address this, we apply Louvain community detection algorithm to this very large graph consisting of links between commits and projects. The approach successfully reduces the size of the megacluster with the largest group of highly interconnected projects containing under 100K repositories. We expect the tools that the resulting map of related projects as well as tools and methods to handle the very large graph will serve as a reference set for mining software projects and other applications. Further work is needed to determine different types of relationships among projects induced by shared commits and other relationships, for example, by shared source code or similar filenames."

However, these discussions might demote the contribution of developers who are introverts, possibly leading to sub-optimal solutions and creating work environments that benefit extroverts. Objective: We aim to evaluate whether providing developers with time to work individually and reason about a collective problem is a setting that makes introverts more comfortable to interact and contribute more, ultimately leading to better solutions. Method: We plan to conduct a between-subjects study, with a control group that designs a software solution in a group discussion meeting and a treatment group in which participants work individually before engaging in a meeting. We will assess and compare the amount of contributions of introverts, their subjective experiences, and the designed solutions. Limitations: As extroverts are present in the groups, we are not able to conclude that better solutions are solely due to the increased participation of introverts, but the analyses of their subjective experience and amount of contributions provide evidence to suggest the reason for possible improved designed solutions."

      "Abstract": "At first glance, research based on mining software repositories (MSR) does not seem to be linked with privacy concerns. But when you analyze common MSR-related activities in some detail, privacy issues arise, even in the case of mining public data. GDPR (European Union General Data Protection Regulation), CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) and other international regulations on privacy may affect researchers dealing with personal data. Even if the data is public. Even if it was uploaded by individuals themselves, with perfect knowledge about what they were doing. Even if the researcher is in a different country of those enacting the regulations. \nThis talk will explain which research activities related to MSR are potentially of concern with respect to privacy issues, to which extent researchers should be concerned, and how we should deal with those concerns to ensure we minimize the potential legal and ethical effects."

Apart from the apparent benefits, online repositories offer a deluge of data that can be utilized to monitor and improve the software development process. Towards this direction, we have designed and implemented a platform that analyzes data from GitHub in order to compute a series of metrics that quantify the contributions of project collaborators, both from a development as well as an operations (communication) perspective. We analyze contributions in an evolutionary manner throughout the projects’ lifecycle and track the number of coding violations generated, this way aspiring to identify cases of software development that need closer monitoring and (possibly) further actions to be taken. In this context, we have analyzed the 3000 most popular Java GitHub projects and provide the data to the community."

To enhance the usability of this data, we describe five representations we have devised for working with, mining from, and analyzing these Dockerfiles. Each Dockerfile representation builds upon the previous ones, and the final representation, created by three levels of nested parsing and abstraction, makes tasks such as mining and static checking tractable. The Dockerfiles, in each of the five representations, along with metadata and the tools used to shepard the data from one representation to the next are all available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3628771."

While experts enjoy increased productivity due to these abstractions, the flow of the programs is often hard to understand for non-experts and newcomers due to implicit flow and concealed lower-level action that seems like ``magic\"\". We conjecture that converting these implicit flows into an explicit and unified form can help non-experts comprehend the programs using these frameworks. We call the process of unifying distributed, implicit flows into a single routine \\emph{deimplicitization}. \nWe want to conduct an experiment that studies the impact of deimplicitization on program comprehension. Particularly, we want to study how software developers with different expertise (novices/students, framework experts/professional developers) can answer comprehension questions differently with respect to time and correctness, under the treatments of either a deimplicitized version of the program in Python or the original version of the program in Ruby on Rails."

      "Abstract": "The growth of the video game market, the large proportion of games targeting mobile devices or streaming services, and the increasing complexity of video games trigger the availability of video game-specific tools to assess performance and maintainability problems. This paper proposes UnityLinter, a static analysis tool that aids Unity video game developers to identify seven types of bad smells we have identified as relevant in video game development. Such smell types pertain to performance, maintainability and incorrect behavior problems. After having defined the smells by analyzing the existing literature and discussion forums, we have assessed their relevance with a survey involving 68 participants. Then, we have analyzed the occurrence of the studied smells in 100 open-source Unity projects, and also assessed UnityLinter’s accuracy. Results of our empirical investigation indicate that developers well-received performance- and behavior-related issues, while some maintainability issues are more controversial. UnityLinter is, in general, accurate enough in detecting smells (86%-100% precision and 50%-100% recall), and our study shows that the studied smell types occur in 39%-97% of the analyzed projects."

      "Abstract": "SMT solvers are at the basis of many applications, such as program verification, program synthesis, and test case generation. For all these applications to provide reliable results, SMT solvers must answer queries correctly. However, since they are complex, highly-optimized software systems, ensuring their correctness is challenging. In particular, state-of-the-art testing techniques do not reliably detect when an SMT solver is unsound. \nIn this paper, we present an automatic approach for generating test cases that reveal soundness errors in the implementations of string solvers, as well as potential completeness and performance issues. We synthesize input formulas that are satisfiable or unsatisfiable by construction and use this ground truth as test oracle. We automatically apply satisfiability-preserving transformations to generate increasingly-complex formulas, which allows us to detect many errors with simple inputs and, thus, facilitates debugging. \nThe experimental evaluation shows that our technique effectively reveals bugs in the implementation of widely-used SMT solvers and applies also to other types of solvers, such as automata-based solvers. We focus on strings here, but our approach carries over to other theories and their combinations."

Whilst statistics support the notion that Finland is performing well compared to many other countries in terms of workplace equality, there are still many areas for improvement. This paper focuses on the problems that some women face in obtaining software engineering roles. We report a preliminary analysis of survey data from 252 respondents. These are mainly women who have shown an interest in gaining programming roles by joining the Mimmit koodaa initiative, which aims to increase equality and diversity within the software industry. The survey sought to understand what early experiences may influence later career choices and feelings of efficacy and confidence needed to pursue technology-related careers. These initial findings reveal that women’s feelings of computing self-efficacy and attitudes towards software engineering are shaped by early experiences. More negative experiences decrease the likelihood of working in software engineering roles in the future, despite expressing an interest in the field."

      "Abstract": "Feature flags are commonly used in mobile app development and can introduce technical debt related to deleting their usage from the codebase. This can adversely affect the overall reliability of the apps and increase their maintenance complexity. The absence of a developer initiative in reducing this debt necessitates the design of novel tools and workflows. \nIn this paper, we describe the design and implementation of Piranha, an automated code refactoring tool which is used to automatically generate differential revisions (a.k.a diffs) to delete code corresponding to stale feature flags. Piranha takes as input the name of the flag, expected treatment behavior, and the name of the flag’s author. It analyzes the ASTs of the program to generate appropriate refactorings which are packaged into a diff. The diff is assigned to the author of the flag for further processing, who can land it after performing any additional refactorings. \nWe have implemented Piranha to delete code in Objective-C,Java, and Swift programs and deployed it to handle stale flags in multiple Uber apps. We present our experiences with the deployment of Piranha from Dec 2017 to May 2019, including the following highlights: (a) generated code cleanup diffs for 1381 flags (17% of total flags), (b) 65% of the diffs landed without any changes, (c) over85% of the generated diffs compile and pass tests successfully, (d)around 80% of the diffs affect more than one file, (e) developers pro-cess more than 88% of the generated diffs, (f ) 75% of the generated diffs are processed within a week, and (g) Piranha diffs have been interacted with by ~200 developers across Uber."

      "Abstract": "Highly-configurable software systems can have thousands of interdependent configuration options across different subsystems. In the resulting configuration space, discovering a valid product configuration for some selected options can be complex and error prone. The configuration space can be organized using a feature model, fragmented into smaller interdependent feature models reflecting the configuration options of each subsystem. \nWe propose a method for lazy product discovery in large fragmented feature models with interdependent features. We formalize the method and prove its soundness and completeness. The evaluation explores an industrial-size configuration space. The results show that lazy product discovery has significant performance benefits compared to standard product discovery, which in contrast to our method requires all fragments to be composed to analyze the feature model. Furthermore, the method succeeds when more efficient, heuristics-based engines fail to find a valid configuration."

      "Abstract": "Among the many software testing techniques available today, \\emph{fuzzing} has remained highly popular due to its conceptual simplicity, its low barrier to deployment, and its vast amount of empirical evidence in discovering real-world software vulnerabilities. \nOur survey shows the fuzzing community is extremely vibrant. The recent surge of work by researchers and practitioners alike has made it difficult to gain a comprehensive and coherent view of fuzzing. Thus, it is easy to lose track of the design decisions and potentially important tweaks performed in each tool and paper. Furthermore, there has been an observable fragmentation in the terminology used by various fuzzers. For example, test case “minimization” and “reduction” are often used interchangeably. Such fragmentation makes it difficult to discover and disseminate knowledge and may severely hinder the progress in fuzzing research in the long run. \nTo help preserve and bring coherence to the vast literature of fuzzing, this paper presented a unified, general-purpose model of fuzzing together with a taxonomy of the current literature. Our terminology is chosen to closely reflect the current predominant usages, and our model is designed to suit a large number of fuzzing tasks. We surveyed academic papers from the major Security and Software Engineering conferences in the last 10 years, as well as projects having more than 100 stars on GitHub. The paper methodically explores the design decisions at every stage of the model by surveying the related literature and innovations that make modern-day fuzzers effective."

      "Abstract": "Floating point is widely used in software to emulate arithmetic over reals. Unfortunately, floating point leads to rounding errors that propagate and accumulate during execution. Generating inputs to maximize the numerical error is critical when evaluating the accuracy of floating-point code. In this paper, we formulate the problem of generating high error-inducing floating-point inputs as a code coverage maximization problem solved using symbolic execution. Specifically, we define inaccuracy checks to detect large precision loss and cancellation. We inject these checks at strategic program locations to construct specialized branches that, when covered by a given input, are likely to lead to large errors in the result. We apply symbolic execution to generate inputs that exercise these specialized branches, and describe optimizations that make our approach practical. We implement a tool named FPGen and present an evaluation on 21 numerical programs including matrix computation and statistics libraries. We show that FPGen exposes errors for 20 of these programs and triggers errors that are, on average, over 2 orders of magnitude larger than the state of the art."

      "Abstract": "Uncontrolled memory consumption is a kind of critical software security weaknesses. It can also become a security-critical vulnerability when attackers can take control of the input to consume a large amount of memory and launch a Denial-of-Service attack. However, detecting such vulnerability is challenging, as the state-of-the-art fuzzing techniques focus on the code coverage but not memory consumption. To this end, we propose a memory usage guided fuzzing technique, named MemLock, to generate the excessive memory consumption inputs and trigger uncontrolled memory consumption bugs. The fuzzing process is guided with memory consumption information so that our approach is general and does not require any domain knowledge. We perform a thorough evaluation for MemLock on 14 widely-used real-world programs. Our experiment results show that MemLock substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzing techniques, including AFL, AFLfast, PerfFuzz, FairFuzz and QSYM, in discovering memory consumption bugs. During the experiments, we discovered many previously unknown memory consumption bugs and received 15 new CVEs."

      "Abstract": "Students face difficulties when transitioning from introductory programming to using more complex enterprise technologies, such as libraries, software frameworks and development kits. Despite much literature being devoted to how to teach introductory programming effectively, less attention is devoted towards managing the transition towards more complex technologies. This work presents the design, experience and evaluation of a module that engages students with a range of enterprise technologies. The module uses peer teaching to transfer the responsibility to students for teaching each other about the technologies. As such, this reduces the need for the teacher to invest time in preparing materials, and it is feasible to cover more technologies depending upon the number of teaching teams. The evaluation, conducted on a cohort of 34 students studying six enterprise technologies over the course of one week, revealed overwhelmingly positive experiences with this approach. For the teacher, effort for preparation and delivery was minimal, and the feedback on the module was highly positive."

      "Abstract": "The number of vulnerabilities increases rapidly in recent years, due to the advances in vulnerability discovery solutions. It enables a thorough analysis on the vulnerability distribution and provides support for correlation analysis and prediction of vulnerabilities. Previous research either focuses on analyzing bugs rather than vulnerabilities, or only studies general vulnerability distribution among projects rather than the distribution within each project. In this paper, we collected a large vulnerability dataset, consisting of all known vulnerabilities associated to a set of representative open source projects, by utilizing automated crawlers and spending months of manual efforts. We then analyzed the vulnerability distribution within each project over several dimensions, including files, functions, vulnerability types and liable developers. Based on the analysis results, we presented several practical insights on the distribution of vulnerabilities. Finally, we applied such insights on several vulnerability discovery solutions (including static analysis and dynamic fuzzing), and helped them found 10 zero-day vulnerabilities in target projects, proving that our insights are useful."

      "Abstract": "Defect models are analytical models for building empirical theories related to software quality. Prior studies often derive knowledge from such models using interpretation techniques, e.g., ANOVA Type-I. Recent work raises concerns that correlated metrics may impact the interpretation of defect models. Yet, the impact of correlated metrics in such models has not been investigated. In this paper, we investigate the impact of correlated metrics on the interpretation of defect models and the improvement of the interpretation of defect models when removing correlated metrics. Through a case study of 14 publicly- available defect datasets, we find that (1) correlated metrics have the largest impact on the consistency, the level of discrepancy, and the direction of the ranking of metrics, especially for ANOVA techniques. On the other hand, we find that removing all correlated metrics (2) improves the consistency of the produced rankings regardless of the ordering of metrics (except for ANOVA Type-I); (3) improves the consistency of ranking of metrics among the studied interpretation techniques; (4) impacts the model performance by less than 5 percentage points. Thus, when one wishes to derive sound interpretation from defect models, one must (1) mitigate correlated metrics especially for ANOVA analyses; and (2) avoid using ANOVA Type-I even if all correlated metrics are removed."

These constraints are particularly crucial for the reliability, maintability, and usability of database-backed web applications, where a huge amount of structured data is expected to persist in database and serve web users throughout software upgrade and database migration. In this paper, our comprehensive study about where data constraints are expressed, what they are about, when they evolve, and how their violations are handled in Ruby on Rails applications demonstrates that real-world developers struggle at maintaining consistent data constraints and constraint checking across different components and different versions of web applications, which led to many real-world software reliability, maintanability, and usability problems. Guided by our study, we developed checking tools and API enhancements that can automatically detect and help fix problems in data-constraint specification and violation handling."

      "Abstract": "PyPI is a major central repository for Python projects. It has indexed millions of libraries to allow developers to automatically download and install dependencies of their projects based on the specified version constraints. Despite the convenience brought by automation, version constraints in Python projects can easily conflict, resulting in build failures. We refer to such conflict issues as dependency conflict (DC) issues. Although DC issues are common in Python projects, developers lack tool support to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the version constraints specified by different projects and diagnose the root causes of these issues. In this paper, we conducted an empirical study on 235 real-world DC issues collected from 124 popular Python projects. We studied the manifestation patterns and fixing strategies of these issues and found several key factors leading to potential DC issues and their regressions. Based on our findings, we designed and implemented Watchman, a technique to continuously monitor dependency conflicts for the PyPI ecosystem. In our evaluation, Watchman analyzed PyPI snapshots between 11 Jul 2019 and 16 Aug 2019, and found 117 potential DC issues. We reported these issues to the concerned developers. So far, 63 issues have been confirmed, of which 38 have been quickly fixed using our suggested patches."

In my study, I investigate the following question: how do FOSS communities sustain their software quality? I argue that human and social factors contribute to the sustainability of quality in FOSS communities. Amongst these factors are: the motivation of participants, robust governance style for the software change process, and the exercise of good practices in the pull requests evaluation process."

      "Abstract": "Logging is a common practice in software engineering. Prior research has investigated the characteristics of logging practices in system software (e.g., web servers or databases) as well as desktop applications. However, despite the popularity of mobile apps, little is known about their logging practices. In this paper, we sought to study logging practices in mobile apps. In particular, we conduct a case study on 1,444 open source Android apps in the F-Droid repository. Through a quantitative study, we find that although mobile app logging is less pervasive than server and desktop applications, logging is leveraged in almost all studied apps. However, we find that there exist considerable differences between the logging practices of mobile apps and the logging practices in server and desktop applications observed by prior studies. In order to further understand such differences, we conduct a firehouse email interview and a qualitative annotation on the rationale of using logs in mobile app development. By comparing the logging level of each logging statement with developers’ rationale of using the logs, we find that all too often (35.4%), the chosen logging level and the rationale are inconsistent. Such inconsistency may prevent the useful runtime information to be recorded or may generate unnecessary logs that may cause performance overhead. Finally, to understand the magnitude of such performance overhead, we conduct a performance evaluation between generating all the logs and not generating any logs in eight mobile apps. In general, we observe a statistically significant performance overhead based on various performance metrics (response time, CPU and battery consumption). In addition, we find that if the performance overhead of logging is significantly observed in an app, disabling the unnecessary logs indeed provides a statistically significant performance improvement. Our results show the need for a systematic guidance and automated tool support to assist in mobile logging practices."

Effectively achieving the above-mentioned goals requires reuse analysis of the product line features. Existing requirements reuse analysis approaches are not focused on recommending product line features, that can be reused to realize new customer requirements. \nHypothesis: Given that the customer requirements are linked to product line features’ description satisfying them: then the customer requirements can be clustered based on patterns and similarities, preserving the historic reuse information. New customer requirements can be evaluated against existing customer requirements and reuse of product line features can be recommended. \nContributions: We treated the problem of feature reuse analysis as a text classification problem at the requirements-level. We use Natural Language Processing and clustering to recommend reuse of features based on similarities and historic reuse information. The recommendations can be used to realize new customer requirements."

      "Abstract": "Application programming interfaces (APIs) have become ubiquitous in software development. However, external APIs are not guaranteed to contain every desirable feature, nor are they immune to software defects. Therefore, API users must sometimes be faced with situations where a current API does not satisfy all of their requirements but migrating to another API is costly. In these cases, due to the lack of communication channels between API developers and users, API users may intentionally bypass the existing API after inquiring into workarounds for their API problems with online communities. This mechanism takes the API developer out of the conversation, potentially leaving API bugs unreported and desirable API features undiscovered. In this paper, we explore API workaround inquiries from API users on Stack Overflow. We determine eight general reasons why API users inquire about API workarounds and eight general solutions to API workaround requests. Furthermore, using workaround implementations in Stack Overflow answers, we develop three API workaround implementation patterns. We identify instances of these patterns in real-life open source project and determine their value for API developers from their responses to feature requests based on the identified API workarounds."

      "Abstract": "Merge conflicts are inevitable in collaborative software development and are disruptive. When they occur, developers have to stop their current work, understand the conflict and the surrounding code, and plan an appropriate resolution. However, not all conflicts are equally problematic—some can be easily fixed, while others might be complicated enough to need multiple people. Currently, there is not much support to help developers plan their conflict resolution. In this work, we aim to predict the difficulty of a merge conflict so as to help developers plan their conflict resolution. The ability to predict the difficulty of a merge conflict and to identify the underlying factors for its difficulty can help tool builders improve their conflict detection tools to prioritize and warn developers of difficult conflicts. In this work, we investigate the characteristics of difficult merge conflicts, and automatically classify them. We analyzed 6,380 conflicts across 128 java projects and found that merge conflict difficulty can be accurately predicted (AUC of 0.76) through machine learning algorithms, such as bagging."

      "Abstract": "Collaborative software development platforms (such as GitHub and GitLab) have become increasingly popu- lar as they have attracted thousands of external contributors to open source projects. External contributors may submit their contributions via pull requests (PRs), which must be reviewed before being integrated into the central repository. During the review process, reviewers provide feedback to contributors, conduct tests and request further modifications before finally accepting or rejecting the contributions. The role of reviewers is key to maintain the effective review process of the project. However, the number of decisions that reviewers can take is far superseded by the increasing number of pull requests submissions. Reviewers need help to perform more decisions on pull requests within their limited working time. In this paper [2], we propose a learning-to-rank (LtR) approach to recommend pull requests that can be quickly reviewed by reviewers. Different from a binary model for predicting the decisions of pull requests, our ranking approach complements the existing list of pull requests based on their likelihood of being quickly merged or rejected. We use 18 metrics to build LtR models and we use six different LtR algorithms, such as ListNet, RankNet, MART and random forest. We conduct empirical studies on 74 Java projects to compare the performances of the six LtR algorithms."

      "Abstract": "Units of measurement (UoM) libraries are mostly used to appropriately encode unit variables and convert between them in a type-safe manner. Approximately 3700 functioning unit measurement libraries exist on the web, indicating that the wheel is being reinvented time and time again. Previous research has postulated that too much diversity, lack of code sharing and duplicated efforts are discouraging adoption, yet more remains to be known. Three developers and a scientist were interviewed and 91 practitioners of varying experiences from online forums were surveyed to explain their dissatisfaction with UoM libraries and possible reasons behind the lack of adoption. Our findings range from insufficient awareness of these UoM’s, to development processes that exclude unit information through to specific performance concerns. We conclude with recommendations to UoM library creators stemming from these points that could help alleviate the problem and lead to an increased adoption rate of methodologies that support unit annotation and checking."

      "Abstract": "Static analyses have problems modelling dynamic language features soundly while retaining acceptable precision. The problem is well-understood in theory, but there is little evidence on how this impacts the analysis of real-world programs. We have studied this issue for call graph construction on a set of \\datasetsize real-world Java programs using an oracle of actual program behaviour recorded from executions of built-in and synthesised test cases with high coverage, have measured the recall that is being achieved by various static analysis algorithms and configurations, and investigated which language features lead to static analysis false negatives. \nWe report that (1) the median recall is 0.884 suggesting that standard static analyses have significant gaps with respect to the proportion of the program modelled (2) built-in tests are significantly better to expose dynamic program behaviour than synthesised tests (3) adding precision to the static analysis has little impact on recall indicating that those are separate concerns (4) state-of-the-art support for dynamic language features can significantly improve recall (the median observed is 0.935), but it comes with a hefty performance penalty, and (5) the main sources of unsoundness are not reflective method invocations, but objects allocated or accessed via native methods, and invocations initiated by the JVM, without matching call sites in the program under analysis. \nThese results provide some novel insights into the interaction between static and dynamic program analyses that can be used to assess the utility of static analyse results and to guide the development of future static and hybrid analyses."

      "Abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) have been shown to be notoriously brittle to small perturbations in their input data. This problem is analogous to the over-fitting problem in test-based program synthesis and automatic program repair, which is a consequence of the incomplete specification, the limited tests or training examples, that the program synthesis or repair algorithm has to learn from. Recently, test generation techniques have been successfully employed to augment existing specifications of intended program behavior, to improve the generalizability of program synthesis and repair. Inspired by these approaches, in this paper, we propose a technique that re-purposes software testing methods, specifically mutation-based fuzzing, to augment the training data of DNNs, with the objective of enhancing their robustness. Our technique casts the DNN data augmentation problem as an optimization problem. It uses genetic search to generate the most suitable variant of an input data to use for training the DNN, while simultaneously identifying opportunities to accelerate training by skipping augmentation in many instances. We instantiate this technique in two tools, SENSEI and SENSEI-SA, and evaluate them on 15 DNN models spanning 5 popular image data-sets. Our evaluation shows that SENSEI can improve the robust accuracy of the DNN, compared to the state of the art, on each of the 15 models, by upto 11.9% and 5.5% on average. Further, SENSEI-SA can reduce the average DNN training time by 25%, while still improving robust accuracy."

      "Abstract": "Developers write logging statements to generate logs and record system execution behaviors to assist in debugging and software maintenance. However, there exists no practical guidelines on where to write logging statements. On one hand, adding too many logging statements may introduce superfluously trivial logs and performance overheads. On the other hand, logging too little may miss necessary runtime information. Thus, properly deciding the logging location is a challenging task and a finer-grained understanding of where to write logging statements is needed to assist developers in making logging decisions. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study to uncover guidelines on logging locations at the code block level. We analyze logging statements and their surrounding code by combining both deep learning techniques and manual investigations. From our preliminary results, we find that our deep learning models achieve over 90% in precision and recall when trained using the syntactic (e.g., nodes in abstract syntax tree) and semantic (e.g., variable names) features. However, cross-system models trained using semantic features only have 45.6% in precision and 73.2% in recall, while models trained using syntactic features still have over 90% precision and recall. Our current progress highlights that there is an implicit syntactic logging guideline across systems, and such information may be leveraged to uncover general logging guidelines."

      "Abstract": "A wide range of tools exist to assist developers in creating secure software. Many of these tools, such as static analysis engines or security checkers included in compilers, use warnings to communicate security issues to developers. The effectiveness of these tools relies on developers heeding these warnings, and there are many ways in which these warnings could be displayed. While ample research has been invested into understanding how end users interact with security warnings, there is far less information on developers. For this paper, we intend to gather insights into what developers want from security warnings, including what form they should take and how they should integrate into their workflow and work context. To this end, we conducted a Grounded Theory study with 14 professional software developers and 12 computer science students as well as a focus group with 7 academic researchers to gather qualitative insights. To back up the theories developed from the qualitative research, we ran a quantitative survey with 50 professional software developers. Our results show that there is significant heterogeneity amongst developers and that no one warning type is preferred over all others. The context in which the warnings are shown is also highly relevant, indicating that it is likely to be beneficial if IDEs and other development tools become more flexible in their warning interactions with developers. Based on our findings, we provide concrete recommendations for both future research as well as how IDEs and other security tools can improve their interaction with developers."

      "Abstract": "Software testing is an important phase in the software development lifecycle because it helps in identifying bugs in a software system before it is shipped into the hand of its end users. There are numerous studies on how developers test general-purpose software applications. The idiosyncrasies of mobile software applications, however, set mobile apps apart from general-purpose systems (e.g., desktop, stand-alone applications, web services). \nThis paper investigates working habits and challenges of mobile software developers with respect to testing. A key finding of our exhaustive study, using 1000 Android apps, demonstrates that mobile apps are still tested in a very ad hoc way, if tested at all. This might be explained by the complexity of test maintenance reported in previous work. \nWe show that, as in other types of software, testing increases the quality of apps (demonstrated in user ratings and number of code issues). Furthermore, we find evidence that tests are essential when it comes to engaging the community to contribute to mobile open source software. We discuss reasons and potential directions to address our findings. Yet another relevant finding of our study is that Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are rare in the mobile apps world (only 26% of the apps are developed in projects employing CI/CD) – we argue that one of the main reasons is due to the lack of exhaustive and automatic testing."

      "Abstract": "Developers typically rely on regression testing to know if their recent changes caused any regressions. However, flaky tests, which are tests that may pass or fail even without code changes, can provide misleading signals to developers. In recent years there has been considerable interest from industry and academia on flaky tests. However, there still aren’t many studies on the reproducibility, runtime, causes, and fixes of flaky tests, particularly in industry. \nTo fill such gap, we study the lifecycle of flaky tests on six large-scale industrial projects within AnonCompany. More specifically, we study the prevalence, reproducibility, characteristics, categories, and resolution of flaky tests. Our study on the prevalence of flaky tests informs us of the impact flaky tests have on the developers at AnonCompany. To understand a major challenge developers have for debugging and fixing flaky tests, we then proceed to study the reproducibility of flaky-test failures. Realizing the challenge developers face when debugging and fixing flaky tests, we proceed to characterize and categorize the flaky tests within AnonCompany. Lastly, we study how long developers take and how effective they are at fixing flaky tests to understand their resolution process of flaky tests. We believe that our study can help reaffirm findings from an industrial setting that previous studies on open-source projects have found and provide many new insights regarding the lifecycle of flaky tests that can help guide future research on the important topic of flaky tests."

      "Abstract": "Modeling is a core topic in Software Engineering Education. Nevertheless, students face difficulties while learning software modeling. One possible cause is the traditional teacher-centered approach that still dominates in Computer Science. To teach software modeling effectively in computing courses, instructors who usually employed traditional methods could use active learning strategies. However, instructors are reluctant to change their teaching approaches due to several barriers that hinder the application of active learning strategies. Besides, relatively little research addresses how to mitigate them. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to help instructors implementing active learning strategies when teaching software modeling. To achieve this objective, we conducted a Design Science Research (DSR). We proposed an artifact called OpenSMALS, an Open Repository for Software Modeling Teaching using Active Learning Strategies. OpenSMALS provides specific guidelines on how instructors can apply these strategies and helping instructors to identify the active learning strategies best suit their teaching context. We performed three DSR design cycles—in four different universities—to evaluate the use of OpenSMALS. Our results show that OpenSMALS satisfactorily reduced the barriers faced by instructors, and it achieved an appropriate maturity level to be adopted by other instructors."

Meanwhile, there exist redundancies in bug reports (written in natural language) across different apps that have not been previously reused. In this paper, we propose \\emph{collaborative bug finding}, a novel approach that uses similarities between different Android apps for finding relevant bug reports that help in the discovery of new bugs. Given an app under test, our approach uses interactions between programmers for deriving specialized test scenarios. We design three settings with varying degrees of interactions between programmers where each setting emulates a different real-world scenarios. Our studies of the first two settings in a software testing course show that collaborative bug finding helps students who are novice Android app testers to discover 17 new bugs. However, students admit that searching for relevant bug reports could be time-consuming. Based on students’ feedback, we introduce Bugine, an approach that automatically recommends relevant GitHub issues for a given app. Our results show that Bugine is able to find 34 new bugs. In total, collaborative bug finding helps us to find 51 new bugs, in which five have been confirmed and seven have been fixed by the developers. These results confirm our intuition that our proposed technique is useful in discovering new bugs for Android apps."

      "Abstract": "Serious games have become a popular alternative learning tool for computer programming education. Research has shown that serious games provide benefits including the development of problem solving skills and increased engagement in the learning process. Despite the benefits, a major challenge of developing serious games is their ability to accommodate students with different educational backgrounds and levels of competency. Learners with a high-level of competence may find a serious games to be too easy or boring, while learners with low-level competence may be frequently frustrated or find it difficult to progress through the game. One solution to this challenge is to use automated adaptation that can alter game content and adjust game tasks to a level appropriate for the learner. The use of adaptation has been successfully utilized in educational domains outside of Software Engineering, but has not been applied to serious programming games. This paper presents GidgetML, an adaptive version of the Gidget programming game, that uses machine learning to modify game tasks based on assessing and predicting learners’ competencies. To assess the benefits of adaptation, we have conducted a study involving 100 students in a first-year university programming course. Our study compared the use of Gidget (non-adaptive) with GidgetML (adaptive) and found that students who played Gidget during lab sessions varied significantly in their performance while this variance was significantly reduced for students who played GidgetML."

      "Abstract": "Bug severity is an important factor in prioritizing which bugs to fix first. The process of triaging bug reports and assigning a severity requires developer expertise and knowledge of the underlying software. Methods to automate the assignment of bug severity have been developed to reduce the developer cost, however, many of these methods require 70-90% of the project’s bug reports as training data and delay their use until later in the development process. Not being able to automatically predict a bug report’s severity early in a project can greatly reduce the benefits of automation. We have developed a new bug report severity prediction method that leverages how bug reports are written rather than what the bug reports contain. Our method allows for the prediction of bug severity at the beginning of the project by using an organization’s historical data, in the form of bug reports from past projects, to train the prediction classifier. In validating our approach, we conducted over 1000 experiments on a dataset of five NASA robotic missions software projects. Our results demonstrate that our method was not able to predict the severity of bugs earlier in development, but it was also able to outperform an existing keyword-based classifier for a majority of the NASA projects."

The way of measuring similarity may affect both the efficiency and quality of clustering solutions. However, there has been no previous comparative study of feature extraction methods used to guide mobile app clustering. \nObjective In this paper, we investigate different techniques to compute the similarity of apps based on their textual descriptions and evaluate their effectiveness using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. \nMethod To this end we carry out an empirical study comparing five different techniques, based on topic modelling and keyword feature extraction, to cluster 12,664 apps randomly sampled from the Google Play App Store. The comparison is based on three main criteria: silhouette width measure, human judgement and execution time. \nResults The results of our study show that using topic modelling, in addition to collocation-based and dependency-based feature extractors perform similarly in detecting app-feature similarity. However, dependency-based feature extraction performs better than any other in finding application domain similarity (ρ \u003d 0.7, p − value \u0026lt; 0.01). \nConclusions Current categorisation in the app store studied does not exhibit a good classification quality in terms of the claimed feature space. However, a better quality can be achieved using a good feature extraction technique and a traditional clustering method."

Compounding this problem, there is a lack of robust, easily adoptable educational accessibility material available to instructors for inclusion in their curricula. To address these issues, we have created five Accessibility Learning Labs (ALL) using an experiential learning structure. The labs are designed to educate and create awareness of accessibility needs in computing. The labs enable easy classroom inclusion by providing instructors with complete educational materials including lecture slides, activities, and quizzes. The labs are hosted on our servers and require only a browser to be utilized. \nTo demonstrate the benefit of our material and the potential benefits of our experiential lab format with empathy-creating material, we conducted a study involving 276 students in ten sections of an introductory computing course. Our findings include: (I) The demonstrated potential of the proposed experiential learning format and labs are effective in motivating students about the importance of accessibility (II) The labs are effective in informing students about foundational accessibility topics (III) Empathy-creating material are demonstrated to be a beneficial component in computing accessibility education, supporting students in placing a higher value on the importance of creating accessible software. Created labs and project materials are publicly available on the project website: http://all.rit.edu"

      "Abstract": "In theory, (good) documentation is an invaluable asset to any software project, as it helps stakeholders to use, understand, maintain, and evolve a system. In practice, however, documentation is generally affected by numerous shortcomings and issues, such as insufficient and inadequate content and obsolete, ambiguous information. To counter this, researchers are investigating the development of advanced recommender systems that automatically suggest high-quality documentation, useful for a given task. A crucial first step is to understand what quality means for practitioners and what information is actually needed for specific tasks. \nWe present two surveys performed with 146 practitioners to investigate (i) the documentation issues they perceive as more relevant together with solutions they apply when these issues arise; and (ii) the types of documentation considered as important given specific tasks. Our findings can help researchers in designing the next generation of documentation recommender systems."

Because both too few and too many comments are undesirable, programmers must judiciously decide where to write code comments. We have created a machine learning model that suggests locations where a programmer should write a code comment. We trained it on existing commented code to learn locations that are chosen by developers. Once trained, the model can predict locations in new code. Our models achieved precision of 74% and recall of 13% in identifying comment-worthy locations.

While there are many different funding models for open-source donations and concerted efforts through foundations, donation platforms like Paypal, Patreon, or OpenCollective are popular and low-bar forms to raise funds for open-source development, for which GitHub recently even built explicit support. With a mixed-method study, we explore the emerging and largely unexplored phenomenon of donations in open source: We quantify how commonly open-source projects ask for donations, statistically model characteristics of projects that ask for and receive donations, analyze for what the requested funds are needed and used, and assess whether the received donations achieve the intended outcomes. We find 25,885 projects asking for donations on GitHub, often to support engineering activities; however, we also find no clear evidence that donations influence the activity level of a project. In fact, we find that donations are used in a multitude of ways, raising new research questions about effective funding."

      "Abstract": "The blockchain technology has potential applications in various areas such as smart-contracts, Internet of Things (IoT), land registry, and supply chain management. Although the Github currently hosts more than eight thousand active Blockchain software (BCS) projects, few software engineering research has investigated these projects and its’ contributors. Although the number of BCS projects is growing rapidly, the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers remain a puzzle. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to understand the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers and analyze the differences between BCS and non-BCS development. On this goal, we sent an online survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified via mining the Github repositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses that met our criteria for analysis. The results suggest that the majority of the BCS developers are experienced in non-BCS development and are primarily motivated by the ideology of creating a decentralized financial system. Although most of the BCS projects are Open Source Software (OSS) projects by nature, more than 93% of our respondents found BCS development somewhat different from a non-BCS development as BCS projects have higher emphasis on security and reliability than most of the non-BCS projects. Other differences include: higher costs of defects, decentralized and hostile environment, technological complexity, and difficulty in upgrading the software after release. These differences were also the primary sources of challenges to them. Software development tools that are tuned for non-BCS development are inadequate for BCS and the ecosystem needs an array of new or improved tools, such as: customized IDE for BCS development tasks, debuggers for smart-contracts, testing support, easily deployable simulators, and BCS domain specific design notations."

      "Abstract": "Improving developer job satisfaction and productivity have been recognized as critical goals by many software companies and are a point of interest in recent company-led surveys. More satisfied developers would allow companies to attract and retain talent, while more productive developers could help reduce costs, increase profits, and improve product quality. Retaining talent is especially important because high turnover introduces challenges with software quality when important knowledge is lost. Productivity is also impacted as new developers have to learn the project landscape and existing developers have to spend time training them. \nThe research we presented in the paper aimed to understand and explain the relationship between job satisfaction and perceived productivity for software engineers. Our investigation was informed by seminal work in organizational psychology, where job satisfaction is widely accepted to be positively correlated with work performance. We built on this work to investigate which factors influence the relationship between developer satisfaction and perceived productivity in software engineering. \nTo develop our theory, we conducted a study in a large software company. The first author spent several months at the company observing and learning how different organizations within this company aimed to understand and measure developers’ productivity and their job satisfaction. The existing efforts in this company revealed that job and engineering tool satisfaction were often used as proxies for perceived productivity. However, not enough was known on how much satisfaction and productivity are related and which other work factors may influence job satisfaction and perceived productivity. Through our empirical investigation we identified the social and technical factors that impact job satisfaction and perceived productivity for software engineers, as well as the perceived importance of these factors. Furthermore, we uncovered the challenges developers face and their impact. Finally, we provided evidence of how the social and technical factors and work context impact the relationship between job satisfaction and perceived productivity, a relationship that was previously assumed or underexplored. \nThe paper contributes a theory that describes how overall job satisfaction and perceived productivity are related and articulates how factors and challenges may impact these constructs for particular developers and specific work contexts. Our theory suggests that improving one without paying attention to the other may be detrimental, and that many different social and technical factors may need to be addressed."

      "Abstract": "As deep neural networks are increasingly being deployed in practice, their efficiency has become an important issue. While there are compression techniques for reducing the network’s size, energy consumption and computational requirement, they only demonstrate empirically that there is no loss of accuracy, but lack formal guarantees of the compressed network, e.g., in the presence of adversarial examples. Existing verification techniques such as ReluVal and DeepPoly provide formal guarantees but they are designed for analyzing a single network instead of the relationship between two networks. To fill the gap, we develop a new method for differential verification of two closely related networks. Our method consists of a fast but approximate forward interval analysis pass and a backward pass that iteratively refines the approximation. There are two main innovations. During the forward pass, we exploit structural and behavioral similarities of the two networks to more accurately compute the symbolic ranges of all neurons. In the backward pass, we leverage the gradient differences to more accurately compute the refinement. Our experiments show that, compared to state-of-theart verification tools, our method can achieve orders-of-magnitude speedup and prove many more properties than existing tools."

      "Abstract": "The engineering of high-quality software requirements generally relies on properties and assumptions about the environment in which the software-to-be has to operate. Such properties and assumptions, referred to as environment conditions in this paper, are highly subject to changes over time or from one software variant to another. As a consequence, the requirements engineered for a specific set of environment conditions may no longer be adequate, complete and consistent for another set. \nThe paper addresses this problem through an automated requirements adaptation technique. A formal requirements modelling framework is considered to make requirements refinements and dependencies on environment conditions explicit. When environment conditions change, an adapted requirements model is computed that is correct with respect to the new environment conditions. The space of possible adaptations is not fixed a priori; the required changes are expected to meet one or more environment-independent goal(s) to be satisfied in both system versions. The adapted requirements model is generated using a new counterexample-guided learning procedure that ensures the correctness of the updated requirements, giving preference to least costly adaptations."

      "Abstract": "Finding bugs in commercial cyber-physical system development tools such as MathWorks Simulink is important in practice, as these tools are widely used to generate embedded code that gets deployed in safety-critical applications such as cars and planes. Equivalence Modulo Input (EMI) based mutation is a new twist on differential testing that promises lower use of computational resources and has already been successful at finding bugs in compilers for procedural languages. To provide EMI-based mutation for differential testing of cyber-physical system development tools, this paper develops several novel mutation techniques. These techniques deal with CPS language features that are not found in procedural languages, such as an explicit notion of execution time and zombie code, which combines properties of live and dead procedural code. In our experiments the most closely related work SLforge found two bugs in the Simulink tool. In comparison, SLEMI found a super-set of issues, including 9 confirmed as bugs by MathWorks Support."

      "Abstract": "Return-oriented programming (ROP) is an effective code-reuse attack in which short code sequences (i.e., gadgets) ending in a ret instruction are found within existing binaries and then executed by taking control of the call stack. The shadow stack, control flow integrity (CFI) and code (re)randomization are three popular techniques for protecting programs against return address overwrites. However, existing runtime rerandomization techniques operate on concrete return addresses, requiring expensive pointer tracking. \nBy adding one level of indirection, we introduce BarRA, the first shadow stack mechanism that applies continuous runtime rerandomization to abstract return addresses for protecting their corresponding concrete return addresses (protected also by CFI), thus avoiding expensive pointer tracking. As a nice side-effect, BarRA naturally combines the shadow stack, CFI and runtime rerandomization in the same framework. The key novelty of BarRA, however, is that once some abstract return addresses are leaked, BarRA will enforce the burn-after-reading property by rerandomizing the mapping from the abstract to the concrete return address space in the order of microseconds instead of seconds required for rerandomizing a concrete return address space. As a result, BarRA can be used as a superior replacement for the shadow stack, as demonstrated by comparing both using the 19 C/C++ benchmarks in SPEC CPU2006 (totalling 2,047,447 LOC) and analyzing a proof-of-concept attack, provided that we can tolerate some slight binary code size increases (by an average of 29.44%) and are willing to use 8MB of dedicated memory for holding up to $2^{20}$ return addresses (on a 64-bit platform). Under an information leakage attack (for some return addresses), the shadow stack is always vulnerable but BarRA is significantly more resilient (by reducing an attacker’s success rate to $\\frac{1}{2^{20}}$ on average). In terms of the average performance overhead introduced, both are comparable: 6.09% (BarRA) vs. 5.38% (the shadow stack)."

      "Abstract": "By bringing together code, text, and examples, Jupyter notebooks have become one of the most popular means to produce scientific results in a productive and reproducible way. As many of the notebook authors are experts in their scientific fields, but laymen with respect to software engineering, one may ask questions on the quality of notebooks and their code. In a preliminary study, we experimentally demonstrate that Jupyter notebooks are inundated with poor quality code, e.g., not respecting recommended coding practices, or containing unused variables and deprecated functions. Considering the education nature of Jupyter notebooks, these poor coding practices, as well as the lacks of quality control, might be propagated into the next generation of developers. Hence, we argue that there is a strong need to programmatically analyze Jupyter notebooks, calling on our community to pay more attention to the reliability of Jupyter notebooks."

It enables a systematic way of generating native applications capable of leveraging specific features and sensors for any target device while contextualizing them to the needs of the application logic. In addition, it provides a way to maintain and update all the deployed instances simultaneously across the variety of target devices, without requiring client-side intervention. The application modelling is geared towards non-technical users, giving them the means to easily create, distribute and manage fully functioning applications across a range of client platforms such as mobile devices or voice assistants without worrying about device-level programming. When required, the generated applications can be quickly customized for better end-user experience by developers with device knowledge, starting from generated code and leveraging the same cloud-based application logic."

      "Abstract": "With the increasing use of smartphone, mobile applications (apps) are ubiquitous in all aspects of human life, therefore, it is required that human values should be reflected in apps. Instead of the importance of considering human values in apps, existing apps pay limited attention to consider human values that are reflected in frequently occurring value breaches incidents with apps. This results in users’ dissatisfaction and several negative socio-economic consequences. To ensure sustainable use of apps, this research aims to provide a direction to the developers on which users’ values they need to focus while developing apps. Towards achieving this goal, we conducted a case study with the existing Bangladeshi agriculture mobile apps to investigate what values users expect from these apps. For this purpose, we manually classified 1522 reviews of 29 existing apps based on a widely used human values theory to explore users’ desired values from these apps as well as to identify the proportion of the presence of these values in the selected apps. Our results show that users expect 21 individual values from these apps where 11 values are already reflected in the apps and 10 values are not. Therefore, we encourage the developers of Bangladeshi agriculture apps to consider these values while developing apps. We believe, this research will be a reference point to conduct similar research with the apps built for other societies to explore the expected values of the users of those apps that will help to develop society-oriented apps."

      "Abstract": "Performance issues can have a devastating impact on the perceived quality of the software. To avoid such problems, the performance of a software system needs to be thoroughly tested and microbenchmarking is a widely used method for precise performance evaluation of specific units of program code. \nMicrobenchmarking frameworks, such as Java’s Microbenchmark Harness (JMH), allow developers to write fine-grained performance test suites at the method or statement level. However, due to the complexities of the Java Virtual Machine, developers often struggle with writing expressive JMH benchmarks which accurately represent the performance of such methods or statements. \nIn this paper, we empirically study bad practices of JMH benchmarks. We develop a tool that leverages static analysis to automatically identify 5 bad JMH practices. Using this tool, we empirically investigate the occurrence of bad JMH practices on 123 open source Java-based systems and found that each of these 5 bad practices is prevalent in open source software. \nFurther, we manually fix 105 benchmarks across 6 projects and quantify the impact of each bad practice in multiple case studies. Our analysis shows that bad practices often significantly impact the benchmark results, distorting the performance counters with large effect sizes. \nTo validate our experimental results, we constructed seven patches that fix the identified bad practices in 57 benchmarks from six of the studied open source projects, of which six were merged into the main branch of the project. In this paper, we show that developers struggle with accurate Java microbenchmarking, and provide several recommendations to developers of microbenchmarking frameworks on how to improve future versions of their framework. \nThe contributions of this paper are as follows: 1. Our study is the first to investigate the prevalence of bad JMH practices on real open-source projects and find that bad JMH practices are common and widespread in Java projects. 2. Our study is the first to quantify the impact of bad JMH practices of real benchmark results. Our results show that bad practices often significantly impact benchmark measurements. 3. We provide a static analysis tool that identifies the occurrence of bad JMH practices in JMH microbenchmarks. This tool can be executed through a batch command using Maven, Gradle or Ant and can be embedded into the CI pipeline of a software project. Also, our tool can be integrated with Eclipse IDE, where the warnings about bad JMH practices are showing directly in the editor view and can be used as a guideline for developers during benchmark development. \nThe full-paper is published in the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering and can be found at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8747433 \nDate of Publication: June 27, 2019"

Our method uses metamorphic relations to check software output for erroneous input in the absence of a tangible test oracle. We use this technique to test two major citation database systems: Scopus and the Web of Science. We report a surprising finding that the inclusion of hyphens in paper titles impedes citation counts, and that this is a result of the lack of robustness of the citation database systems in handling hyphenated paper titles. Our results are valid for the entire literature as well as for individual fields such as chemistry. We further find a strong and significant negative correlation between the journal impact factor (JIF) of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE) and the percentage of hyphenated paper titles published in TSE. Similar results are found for ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology. A software engineering field-wide study reveals that the higher JIF-ranked journals are publishing a lower percentage of papers with hyphenated titles. Our results challenge the common belief that citation counts and JIFs are reliable measures of the impact of papers and journals, as they can be distorted simply by the presence of hyphens in paper titles."

      "Abstract": "In object-oriented languages, constructors often have a combination of required and optional formal parameters. It is tedious and inconvenient for programmers to write a constructor by hand for each combination. The multitude of constructors is error-prone for clients, and client code is difficult to read due to the large number of constructor parameters. Therefore, programmers often use design patters that enable more flexible object construction - the builder pattern, dependency injection, or factory methods. \nHowever, these design patterns can be \\emph{too} flexible: not all combinations of logical parameters lead to the construction of well-formed objects. When a client uses the builder pattern to construct an object, the compiler does not check that a valid set of values was provided. Incorrect use of builders can cause security vulnerabilities, run-time crashes, and other problems. \nThis work shows how to statically verify uses of object construction, such as the builder pattern. Using a simple specification language, programmers specify which combinations of logical arguments are permitted. Our compile-time analysis detects client code that may construct objects unsafely. Our analysis is based on a special case of typestate checking that modularly reasons about accumulations of method calls. It scales to industrial programs. We evaluated it on over 9 million lines of code, discovering defects which include previously-unknown security vulnerabilities and potential null-pointer violations in heavily-used open-source codebases. It has a low false positive rate and low annotation burden."

Traditionally, these sets are computed using system models instantiated with their physical bounds. This exclusive focus on the physical bounds belies the fact that these systems are increasingly driven by sophisticated software components that can also bound the variables in the system models. This work explores the degree to which bounds manifested in the software can affect the computation of reachable sets, introduces an analysis approach to discover such bounds in code, and illustrates the potential of that approach on two systems. The preliminary results reveal that taking into consideration software bounds can reduce traditionally computed reachable sets by up to 90%."

      "Abstract": "Large-scale open source communities, such as the Linux kernel, have gone through decades of development, substantially growing in scale and complexity. In the traditional workflow, maintainers serve as ``gatekeepers\u0027\u0027 for the subsystems that they maintain. As the number of patches and authors significantly increases, maintainers come under considerable pressure and that may hinder the operation and even the sustainability of the community. A few subsystems have begun to use new workflows to address these issues. However, it is unclear to what extent these new workflows are successful, nor what factors are critical to their implementation. Therefore, we conduct an empirical study on the multiple-committer model (MCM) that has provoked extensive discussion in the Linux kernel community. We explore the effect of the model on the i915 subsystem with respect to four dimensions: pressure, latency, complexity, and quality assurance. We find that after this model was adopted, the burden of the i915 maintainers was significantly reduced and also, the model scales well to allow more committers. We propose that overloaded subsystems having trustworthy candidate committers are suitable for adopting this model. We further suggest its success is closely related to a series of measures for risk mitigation—sufficient pre-commit testing, strict review process, and the use of tools to simplify work and reduce errors. We employ a network analysis approach to locate candidate committers for the target subsystems and validate this approach and contextual success factors through email interviews with their maintainers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on how to scale open source communities. We expect that our study will help the rapidly growing Linux kernel and other similar communities to adapt to changes and remain sustainable."

However, this poses the challenge of developing authentic and equitable assessment criteria that reflect individual contributions in a team-work setting without jeopardizing project outcomes. We present a novel and innovative portfolio-based assessment framework that focuses on qualitative outcomes and ensures that the level of achievement reflects a student’s competency across each of the defined learning dimensions, including professional behavior, teamwork, process and relevant contributions towards project deliverables. In this paper, we present the main motivation behind devising and introducing the framework and also reflect on the educational outcomes and challenges of implementing the framework in the context of two final year Software Engineering project units."

      "Abstract": "Smart contract, a term which was originally coined to refer to the automation of legal contracts in general, has recently seen much interest due to the advent of blockchain technology. Recently, the term is popularly used to refer to low-level code scripts running on a blockchain platform. Our study focuses exclusively on this subset of smart contracts. Such smart contracts have increasingly been gaining ground, finding numerous important applications (e.g., crowdfunding) in the real world. Despite the increasing popularity, smart contract development still remains somewhat a mystery to many developers largely due to its special design and applications. Are there any differences between smart contract development and traditional software development? What kind of challenges are faced by developers during smart contract development? Questions like these are important but have not been explored by researchers yet. In this paper, we performed an exploratory study to understand the current state and potential challenges developers are facing in developing smart contracts on blockchains, with a focus on Ethereum (the most popular public blockchain platform for smart contracts). Toward this end, we conducted this study in two phases. In the first phase, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 developers from GitHub and industry professionals who are working on smart contracts. In the second phase, we performed a survey on 232 practitioners to validate the findings from the interviews. Our interview and survey results revealed several major challenges developers are facing during smart contract development: (1) there is no effective way to guarantee the security of smart contract code; (2) existing tools for development are still very basic; (3) the programming languages and the virtual machines still have a number of limitations; (4) performance problems are hard to handle under resource constrained running environment; and (5) online resources (including advanced/updated documents and community support) are still limited. Our study suggests several directions that researchers and practitioners can work on to help improve developers’ experience on developing high-quality smart contracts."

      "Abstract": "A dependency bug is a software fault that manifests itself when accessing an unavailable asset. Dependency bugs are pervasive and we all hate them. This paper presents a case study of dependency bugs in the Robot Operating System (ROS), applying mixed methods: a qualitative investigation of 78 dependency bug reports, a quantitative analysis of 1354 ROS bug reports against 19553 reports in the top 30 GitHub projects, and a design of three dependency linters evaluated on 406 ROS packages. \nThe paper presents a definition and a taxonomy of dependency bugs extracted from data. It describes multiple facets of these bugs and estimates that as many as 15% (!) of all reported bugs are dependency bugs. We show that lightweight tools can find dependency bugs efficiently, although it is challenging to decide which tools to build and difficult to build general tools. We present the research problem to the community, and posit that it should be feasible to eradicate it from software development practice."

      "Abstract": "Developers build programs based on software libraries to reduce coding effort. If a program inappropriately invokes an API parameter, the program may exhibit unexpected runtime behaviors. To help developers correctly use library APIs, researchers built tools to mine API parameter rules. However, some fundamental questions are still unexplored. For instance, what are the parameter rules overlooked by existing work, and how can we automatically extract such rules? In this paper, we conducted a large-scale empirical study to investigate the above-mentioned questions. Specifically, to study as many parameter rules as possible, we took a hybrid approach that combines automatic localization of constrained parameters with manual inspection. Our automatic approach—PARU—locates parameters that have constraints either documented in Javadoc (i.e., document rules) or implied by source code (i.e., code rules). Our manual inspection (1) identifies and categorizes rules for the located parameters, (2) analyzes how well existing tools detect the rules, and (3) identifies the mapping between document and code rules. By applying PARU to 9 widely used libraries, we located 5,334 parameters with either document or code rules. Interestingly, there are only 108 parameters that have both types of rules, and 79 of these parameters have the rules unmatched. Additionally, PARU extracted 1,688 rule-containing sentences from Javadoc and code. We manually classified these sentences into six categories, and discovered that existing techniques can reveal at most three of the categories. Our research reveals the challenges for automating parameter rule extraction, and provides insights for future tool design."

      "Abstract": "Puppet is a popular computer system configuration management tool. It provides abstractions that model system resources, enabling administrators to set up their computer systems. Its use suffers from two potential pitfalls. First, if ordering constraints are not correctly specified whenever a Puppet resource depends on another, the non-deterministic application of resources can lead to race conditions and consequent failures. Second, if a service is not tied to its resources (through the notification construct), the system may operate in a stale state whenever a resource gets modified and the update is not propagated to the corresponding service. Such faults can degrade a computing infrastructure’s availability and functionality. \nWe have developed an approach that identifies these issues through the analysis of a Puppet program and its system call trace. Specifically, we present a formal model for traces, which allows us to capture the interactions of Puppet resources with the file system. By analyzing these interactions we identify (1) resources that are related to each other (e.g., operate on the same file), and (2) resources that should act as notifiers so that changes are correctly propagated. We then check the relationships from the trace’s analysis against the program’s dependency graph: a representation containing all the ordering constraints and notifications declared in the program. If a mismatch is detected, our system reports a potential fault. \nWe have evaluated our method on a large set of popular Puppet modules, and discovered 66 previously unknown issues in 30 of them. Benchmarking further shows that our approach can analyze in seconds real-world configurations with a magnitude measured in thousands of lines and millions of system calls."

Given the rising popularity of incorporating machine learning into systems, we wondered how the addition alters software development practices. We performed a mixture of qualitative and quantitative studies with 14 interviewees and 342 survey respondents from 26 countries across four continents to elicit significant differences between the development of machine learning systems and the development of non-machine-learning systems. Our study uncovers significant differences in various aspects of software engineering (e.g., requirements, design, testing, and process) and work characteristics (e.g., skill variety, problem solving and task identity). Based on our findings, we highlight future research directions and provide recommendations for practitioners."

Recently, the concept of test smell has become the utmost interest of researchers and practitioners. Surveys show that developers’ are aware of test smells and their potential consequences in the software system. However, there is limited empirical evidence for how developers address test smells during software evolution. Thus, in this paper, we study 2 research questions: (RQ1) How do test smells evolve? (RQ2) What is the motivation for removing test smells? Our result shows that Assertion Roulette, Conditional Test Logic and Unknown tests have a high rate of churns, the feature addition and improvement motivate refactoring, but test smell persists, implicating sub-optimal practice. In our study, we hope to fill the gap between academia and industry by providing evidence of sub-optimal practice in the way developers address test smells, and how it may be detrimental to the software."

      "Abstract": "Nowadays, with the rapid growth of open source software (OSS), library reuse becomes more and more popular since a large amount of third- party libraries are available to download and reuse. A deeper understanding on why developers reuse a library (i.e., replacing self-implemented code with an external library) or re-implement a library (i.e., replacing an imported external library with self-implemented code) could help researchers better understand the factors that developers are concerned with when reusing code. This understanding can then be used to improve existing libraries and API recommendation tools for researchers and practitioners, by using the developers concerns identified in this study as design criteria. \nIn this work, we investigated the reasons behind library reuse and re-implementation. To achieve this goal, we first crawled data from two popular sources, F-Droid and GitHub. Then, potential instances of library reuse and re-implementation were found automatically based on certain heuristics. Next, for each instance, we further manually identified whether it is valid or not. For library re-implementation, we obtained 82 instances which are distributed in 75 repositories. We then conducted two types of surveys (i.e., individual survey to corresponding developers of the validated instances and another open survey) for library reuse and re-implementation. For library reuse individual survey, we received 36 responses out of 139 contacted developers. For re-implementation individual survey, we received 13 responses out of 71 contacted developers. In addition, we received 56 responses from the open survey. Finally, we perform qualitative and quantitative analysis on the survey responses and commit logs of the validated instances. \nThe results suggest that library reuse occurs mainly because developers were initially unaware of the library or the library had not been introduced. Re-implementation occurs mainly because the used library method is only a small part of the library, the library dependencies are too complicated, or the library method is deprecated. Finally, based on all findings obtained from analyzing the surveys and commit messages, we provided a few suggestions to improve the current library recommendation systems: tailored recommendation according to users’ preferences, detection of external code that is similar to a part of the users’ code (to avoid duplication or re-implementation), grouping similar recommendations for developers to compare and select the one they prefer, and disrecommendation of poor-quality libraries."

      "Abstract": "Escape analysis is widely used to determine the scope of variables, and is an effective way to optimize memory usage. However, the escape analysis algorithm can hardly reach 100% accurate, mistakes of which can lead to a waste of heap memory. It is challenging to ensure the correctness of programs for memory optimization. \nIn this paper, we propose an escape analysis optimization approach for Go programming language (Golang), aiming to save heap memory usage of programs. First, we compile the source code to capture information of escaped variables. Then, we change the code so that some of these variables can bypass Golang’s escape analysis mechanism, thereby saving heap memory usage and reducing the pressure of memory garbage collection. Next, we present a verification method to validate the correctness of programs, and evaluate the effect of memory optimization. We implement the approach to an automatic tool and make it open-source. For evaluation, we apply our approach to 10 open-source projects. For the optimized Golang code, the heap allocation is reduced by 8.88% in average, and the heap usage is reduced by 8.78% in average. Time consumption is reduced by 9.48% in average, while the cumulative time of GC pause is reduced by 5.64% in average. We also apply our approach to 16 industrial projects in Bytedance Technology. Our approach successfully finds 452 optimized cases which are confirmed by developers."

      "Abstract": "Source code summarization aims to automatically generate concise summaries of source code in natural language texts, in order to help developers better understand and maintain source code. Traditional work generates a source code summary by utilizing information retrieval techniques, which select terms from original source code or adapt summaries of similar code snippets. Recent studies adopt Neural Machine Translation techniques and generate summaries from code snippets using encoder-decoder neural networks. The neural-based approaches prefer the high-frequency words in the corpus and have trouble with the low-frequency ones. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-based neural source code summarization approach where we enhance the neural model with the most similar code snippets retrieved from the training set. Our approach can take advantages of both neural and retrieval-based techniques. Specifically, we first train an attentional encoder-decoder model based on the code snippets and the summaries in the training set; Second, given one input code snippet for testing, we retrieve its two most similar code snippets in the training set from the aspects of syntax and semantics, respectively; Third, we encode the input and two retrieved code snippets, and predict the summary by fusing them during decoding. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our approach and the experimental results show that our proposed approach can improve the state-of-the-art methods."

Furthermore, we show that developers’ emotions can be reliably recognized using only a wristband capturing the electrodermal activity and heart-related metrics."

      "Abstract": "This paper presents our experience in adopting an agile organizational model for a final year capstone program in Software Engineering. The model developed is motivated by having real and developing software artifacts with incrementally changing members working on a product-line. This in turn results in more sophisticated capstone student-project outcomes. The model proposed further supports student mentoring and promotes, through its internal organization, leadership and personal responsibility. The students are supported by professional software engineers, upskilling workshops, and academic supervisors who act as a personalized reporting and grading point for the squads. The academic supervisors are themselves supported by a tribe leader, a faculty member who assumes overall responsibility for the product-line, and who acts as a report to an external industry client/sponsor for the project. This paper describes the motivation for the capstone model, its adoption, and some preliminary observations concerning what has been found to work."

      "Abstract": "Message passing is the standard paradigm of programming in high-performance computing. However, verifying Message Passing Interface (MPI) programs is challenging, due to the complex program features (such as non-determinism and non-blocking operations). In this work, we present MPI symbolic verifier (MPI-SV), the first symbolic execution based tool for automatically verifying MPI programs with non-blocking operations. MPI-SV combines symbolic execution and model checking in a synergistic way to tackle the challenges in MPI program verification. The synergy improves the scalability and enlarges the scope of verifiable properties. We have implemented MPI-SV\\footnote{MPI-SV is available \\url{https://mpi-sv.github.io}.} and evaluated it with 111 real-world MPI verification tasks. The pure symbolic execution-based technique successfully verifies 61 out of the 111 tasks (55%) within one hour, while in comparison, MPI-SV verifies 100 tasks (90%). On average, compared with pure symbolic execution, MPI-SV achieves 19x speedups on verifying the satisfaction of the critical property and 5x speedups on finding violations."

      "Abstract": "As the size of software becomes larger and more complex, finding the cause of defects becomes increasingly difficult. Moreover, it is very hard to reproduce defects when many components such as processes in platform environment or devices in IoT environment are involved. In this case, analyzing logs are the only way to get debugging insights, but manual log analysis is highly labor intensive work. In this paper, we propose a new log analysis system called historian which runs based on history of test logs. Our system first computes importance and noise scores of each log line by using statistical text mining techniques to find abnormal log lines, and then highlights log lines based on computed scores for providing debugging insights. We applied historian to Tizen Native API test logs, and our tool highlighted only about 4% log lines in average. We also provided highlighted failed logs to Tizen developers and the developers said that failure related log lines were highlighted well. These experimental results show that our system effectively highlights abnormal log lines and provides debugging insights to developers."

      "Abstract": "Data scientists frequently analyze data by writing scripts. We conducted a contextual inquiry of interdisciplinary researchers, which revealed that parameter tuning is a highly iterative process and that debugging is time-consuming. As analysis scripts evolve and become more complex, analysts have difficulty conceptualizing their workflow. In particular, after editing a script, it becomes difficult to determine precisely which code blocks depend on the edit. Consequently, scientists frequently re-run entire scripts instead of re-running only the necessary parts. We present ProvBuild, a tool that leverages language-level provenance to streamline the debugging process by reducing programmer cognitive load and decreasing subsequent runtimes, leading to an overall reduction in elapsed debugging time. ProvBuild uses provenance to track dependencies in a script. When an analyst debugs a script, ProvBuild generates a simplified script that contains only the information necessary to debug a particular problem. We demonstrate that debugging the simplified script lowers a programmer’s cognitive load and permits faster re-execution when testing changes. The combination of reduced cognitive load and shorter runtime reduces the time necessary to debug a script. We quantitatively and qualitatively show that even though ProvBuild introduces overhead during a script’s first execution, it is a more efficient way for users to debug and tune complex workflows. ProvBuild demonstrates a novel use of language-level provenance, in which it is used to proactively improve programmer productively rather than merely providing a way to retroactively gain insight into a body of code."

During the last five decades, software engineering has also changed significantly to advance the development of various types and scales of software products. In this context, Software Engineering Education plays an essential role in keeping students updated with software technologies, processes, and practices that are popular in industries. Aim: In this PhD work, I want to answer the following research questions: To what extent software engineering trends are present in software engineering education? In which way software startup in growth-phase characteristics can be transferred into software engineering education context? What is the impact of software startup engineering in the curriculum and to software engineering students? Method: I utilize literature review and mix-methods approaches (quantitative and qualitative data and methods triangulation) in gathering empirical evidence. More precisely, I split my research method into two phases. The first phase of the research will acquire knowledge and insight based on the existing literature review. The second research phase will split the focus in two directions. Firstly, I shall gather empirical evidence on how software startup practices are present in software engineering education. Secondly, I will conduct parallel investigations into SE practices in growth-phase software startups. Expected Results: I argue that software startup engineering practices are an ultimate tool for software engineering education approaches. I expect students to acquire software engineering skills in a more realistic context while using software startup in growth phase practices."

Education has a key role in supporting the development of digital skills even from the early childhood. Designing educational software for preschoolers, that would support learning and digital skills development, needs focus both on children (to ensure engagement) and their instructors (to ensure appropriateness and acceptance). Edutainment software posses educational content and an entertainment model, being a promising perspective in education support. In this paper we propose a user-centered design method that focuses on both users categories (preschoolers and kindergarten teachers) that consists in two steps: product development and product validation. A case study of applying and assessing the proposed method to design educational software for Romanian preschoolers is presented."

      "Abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the core component of modern autonomous driving systems. To date, it is still unrealistic that a DNN will generalize correctly to all driving conditions. Current testing techniques consist of offline solutions that identify adversarial or corner cases for improving the training phase. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the confidence of DNNs in response to unexpected execution contexts with the purpose of predicting potential safety-critical misbehaviours and enabling online healing of DNN-based vehicles. Our approach SelfOracle is based on a novel concept of self-assessment oracle, which monitors the DNN confidence at runtime, to predict unsupported driving scenarios in advance. SelfOracle uses autoencoder- and time series-based anomaly detection to reconstruct the driving scenarios seen by the car, and to determine the confidence boundary between normal and unsupported conditions. In our empirical assessment, we evaluated the effectiveness of different variants of SelfOracle at predicting injected anomalous driving contexts, using DNN models and simulation environment from Udacity. Results show that, overall, SelfOracle can predict 77% misbehaviours, up to six seconds in advance, outperforming the online input validation approach of DeepRoad."

      "Abstract": "Self-adaptive systems often employ dynamic programming or similar techniques to select optimal adaptations at run-time. These techniques suffer from the ‘‘curse of dimensionality’’, increasing the cost of run-time adaptation decisions. We propose a novel approach that improves upon the state-of-the-art proactive self-adaptation techniques to reduce the number of possible adaptations that need be considered for each run-time adaptation decision. The approach, realized in a tool called Thallium, employs a combination of automated formal modeling techniques to (i) analyze a structural model of the system showing which configurations are reachable from other configurations and (ii) compute the utility that can be generated by the optimal adaptation over a bounded horizon in both the best- and worst-case scenarios. It then constructs triangular possibility values using those optimized bounds to automatically compare adjacent adaptations for each configuration, keeping only the alternatives with the best range of potential results. The experimental results corroborate Thallium’s ability to significantly reduce the number of states that need be considered with each adaptation decision, freeing up vital resources at run-time."

      "Abstract": "Heterogeneous computing with field-programmable gate-arrays (FPGAs) has demonstrated orders of magnitude improvement in computing efficiency for many applications. However, the use of such platforms so far is limited to a small subset of programmers with specialized hardware knowledge. High-level synthesis (HLS) tools made significant progress in raising the level of programming abstraction from hardware programming languages to C/C++, but they usually cannot compile and generate accelerators for kernel programs with pointers, memory management, and recursion, and require manual refactoring to make them HLS-compatible. Besides, experts also need to provide heavily handcrafted optimizations to improve resource efficiency, which affects the maximum operating frequency, parallelization, and power efficiency. \nWe propose a new dynamic invariant analysis and automated refactoring technique, called HeteroRefactor. First, HeteroRefactor monitors FPGA-specific dynamic invariants—the required bitwidth of integer and floating-point variables, and the size of recursive data structures and stacks. Second, using this knowledge of dynamic invariants, it refactors the kernel to make traditionally HLS-incompatible programs synthesizable and to optimize the accelerator’s resource usage and frequency further. Third, to guarantee correctness, it selectively offloads the computation from CPU to FPGA, only if an input falls within the dynamic invariant. On average, for a recursive program of size 175 LOC, an expert FPGA programmer would need to write 185 more LOC to implement an HLS compatible version, while HeteroRefactor automates such transformation. Our results on Xilinx FPGA show that HeteroRefactor minimizes BRAM by 83% and increases frequency by 42% for recursive programs; reduces BRAM by 41% through integer bitwidth reduction; and reduces DSP by 50% through floating-point precision tuning."

In the field of testing, the execution of the containerized/virtualized test suite has achieved great savings, but when the complexity or the cost of deployment arises, there are open challenges like the efficient execution of End to End (E2E) test suites. This paper proposes a research problem and a feasible solution that looks for improving resource usage into the E2E tests, towards smart resource identification and a proper organization of its execution in order to achieve efficient and effective resource usage. The resources are characterized by a series of attributes that provide information about the resource and to its usage during the E2E testing phase. The test cases are grouped and scheduled with the resources (i.e. deployed in parallel in the same machine or executed in a fixed arrange), in order to make an efficient execution of the entire test suite, reducing its total cost/time"

      "Abstract": "Formal methods and tools have a long history of successful applications in the design of safety-critical railway products. However, most of the experiences focused on the application of a single method at once, and little work has been performed to compare the applicability of the different available frameworks to the railway context. As a result, companies willing to introduce formal methods in their development process have little guidance on the selection of tools that could fit their needs. To address this goal, this paper presents a comparison between 9 different formal tools, namely Atelier B, CADP, FDR4, NuSMV, ProB, Simulink, SPIN, UMC, and UPPAAL SMC. We performed a judgment study, involving 17 experts with experience in formal methods applied to railways. In the study, part of the experts were required to model a railway signalling problem (the moving-block train distancing system) with the different tools, and to provide feedback on their experience. The information produced was then synthesised, and the results were validated by the remaining experts. Based on the outcome of this process, we provide a synthesis that describes when to use a certain tool, and what are the problems that may be faced by modellers. Our experience shows that the different tools serve different purposes, and multiple formal methods are required to fully cover the needs of the railway system design process."

We specifically go beyond traditional machine-learning courses that teach modeling techniques under artifical conditions and focus, in lecture and assignments, on realism with large and changing datasets, robust and evolvable infrastructure, and purposeful requirements engineering that considers also ethics and fairness. We describe the course and our infrastructure and share experience and all material from teaching the course for the first time."

      "Abstract": "Software automation typically refers to the process of generating software automatically based on formal or informal specifications. In the research community, software automation has been a decades-long dream, where software developers are freed from tedious programming tasks for constructing the initial version of software, and from expensive software maintenance tasks for evolving the software to future versions in order to catch up with the changes from requirements or execution environments. Example software automation technologies include program synthesis, code completion, program transformation, code recommendation, program repair, and software self-evolution. In the past decade, software development, maintenance, and deployment produce a huge volume of software engineering data such as source code, version histories, feature specifications, bug reports, test cases, execution traces/logs, and real-world user feedback. These data supply a valuable source of inputs for software automation technologies. These data supplies provide great potential to substantially boost these technologies’ effectiveness and efficiency toward realizing software automation in not only academic settings but also industrial settings. This technical briefing discusses recent research and future directions in data-driven software automation, as an important objective in the increasingly popular fields of software analytics and intelligent software engineering."

      "Abstract": "App reviews can provide important intelligence that app developers can apply to improve their offerings. Whereas previous research on review analysis has considered the easily extractable elements of an app review (such as topics and sentiment), it has largely ignored the more subtle - and potentially more informative - elements. Specifically, a user’s review of an app would often describe the user’s interactions with the app. These interactions, which we interpret as mini stories, are prominent in reviews with negative ratings. \nIn general, a story in an app review would contain at least two types of events: (1) user actions, indicative of use cases or user expectations and (2) associated app behaviors, indicative of problems that violate the user’s expectations. Being able to identify such stories would enable a developer in better maintaining and improving his or her app’s functionality and enhancing user experience. \nTo this end, we present CASPAR, a method for collecting and analyzing user-reported mini stories regarding app problems from app reviews. CASPAR abstracts event pairs from stories in reviews. By extending and applying natural language processing and deep learning techniques, CASPAR extracts ordered events from app reviews, classifies them as user actions or app problems, and conducts inference on action-problem event pairs. It builds and trains an inference model with the extracted event pairs to predict possible app problems for different use cases. \nCASPAR discovers high-quality event pairs regarding app problems from reviews, and infers plausible app problems for use cases. We conduct two main evaluations. First, CASPAR classifies the events with an accuracy of 82.0% on manually labeled data. Second, relative to human evaluators, CASPAR extracts event pairs with 92.9% precision and 28.9% recall, and infers events with high plausibility. Our dataset and code will be released upon acceptance."

      "Abstract": "Over the last decades, the Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) phenomenon has been a topic of study and a source of real-life artifacts for software engineering. A FLOSS project usually has a community around its project, organically producing informative resources to describe how, when, and why a particular change occurred in the source code or the development flow. Therefore, when studying this kind of project, collecting and analyzing texts and artifacts can promote a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon and the variety of organizational settings. However, despite the importance of examining Grey Literature, such as technical reports, white papers, magazines, and blog posts for studying FLOSS projects, the Grey Literature Review is still an emerging technique in software engineering studies, lacking a well-established investigative methodology. To mitigate this gap, we present and discuss challenges and adaptations for the planning and execution of grey literature reviews in the FLOSS scenario. We provide a set of guidelines and lessons learned for further research, using as an example a review we are conducting on the Linux kernel development model."

      "Abstract": "This paper presents a novel end-to-end approach to program repair based on sequence-to-sequence learning. We devise, implement, and evaluate a technique, called SEQUENCER, for fixing bugs based on sequence-to-sequence learning on source code. This approach uses the copy mechanism to overcome the unlimited vocabulary problem that occurs with big code. Our system is data-driven; we train it on 35,578 samples, carefully curated from commits to open-source repositories. We evaluate SEQUENCER on 4,711 independent real bug fixes, as well on the Defects4J benchmark used in program repair research. SEQUENCER is able to perfectly predict the fixed line for 950/4,711 testing samples, and find correct patches for 14 bugs in Defects4J benchmark. SEQUENCER captures a wide range of repair operators without any domain-specific top-down design."

      "Abstract": "Mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) is a new promising direction toward improving automated fault localization by leveraging mutation testing results. One issue in experimenting MBFL techniques is that MBFL results are more prone to validity threats because there are many factors to control in conducting mutation testing for fault localization. To understand different validity threats in experimenting MBFL, this paper reports our reproduction/revisit of the MBFL assessments with Defects4J with different controlled set ups. Especially, to eliminate the existing noises, we systematically reviewed and revised 26 Defects4J artifacts, From the comparison with the new and the existing experiment results, we found the configuration of the controlled variables change the results of the experiments in a large degree, therefore, these threats to validity must be carefully limited in emprical assessments of mutation-based fault localization techniques."

      "Abstract": "Commercial participation continues to grow in open source software (OSS) projects and novel arrangements appear to emerge in company-dominated projects and ecosystems. What is the nature of these novel arrangements’ Does volunteers’ participation remain critical for these ecosystems’ Despite extensive research on commercial participation in OSS, the exact nature and extent of company contributions to OSS development, and the impact of this engagement may have on the volunteer community have not been clarified. To bridge the gap, we perform an exploratory study of OpenStack: a large OSS ecosystem with intense commercial participation. We quantify companies’ contributions via the developers that they provide and the commits made by those developers. We find that companies made far more contributions than volunteers and the distribution of the contributions made by different companies is also highly unbalanced. We observe eight unique contribution models based on companies’ commercial objectives and characterize each model according to three dimensions: contribution intensity, extent, and focus. Companies providing full cloud solutions tend to make both intensive (more than other companies) and extensive (involving a wider variety of projects) contributions. Usage-oriented companies make extensive but less intense contributions. Companies driven by particular business needs focus their contributions on the specific projects addressing these needs. Minor contributors include community players (e.g., the Linux Foundation) and research groups. A model relating the number of volunteers to the diversity of contribution, shows a strong positive association between them."

      "Abstract": "The employment opportunity for Computer Science (CS), Information Technology and Software Engineering and Development (SE) related occupations is projected to grow much faster than the average of all other occupations. Therefore, increase in student enrollment, retention and graduation rate is becoming very important, so is the need for effective teaching in these subjects. Many universities commonly use formal, institutional Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET) systems to measure the teaching effectiveness. After each semester, through SET, students provide feedback and comments for their courses and instructors. However, evaluations are private and only a handful people have access to these. Therefore, these evaluations cannot be utilized to create a common understanding of the students’ expectations, perspective, desired characteristics of the courses and instructors. On the other hand, third party online platforms like RateMyProfessor.com (RMP) are public, solicit anonymous student feedback and host tremendous amount of data about the instructors and their courses. These platforms are also popular among students. We mined and analyzed the RMP data for some research questions, e.g.: What are the common characteristics of the popular CS instructors? How different are they for the SE instructors? Are there any examples of special characteristics, tools and techniques popular CS instructors use? We captured and analyzed more than 9,000 students’ comments for over 300 CS instructors for the top 20 universities in the U.S. and Canada. The paper contributes by presenting the findings for the research questions and making the data and the scripts available for public use for future research."

      "Abstract": "Context: Requirements Engineering (RE) has established itself as a software engineering discipline over the past decades. While researchers have been investigating the RE discipline with a plethora of empirical studies, attempts to systematically derive an empirical theory in context of the RE discipline have just recently been started. However, such a theory is needed if we are to define and motivate guidance in performing high quality RE research and practice. Objective: We aim at providing an empirical and externally valid foundation for a theory of RE practice, which helps software engineers establish effective and efficient RE processes in a problem-driven manner. Method: We designed a survey instrument and an engineer-focused theory that was first piloted in Germany and, after making substantial modifications, has now been replicated in 10 countries world-wide. We have a theory in the form of a set of propositions inferred from our experiences and available studies, as well as the results from our pilot study in Germany. We evaluate the propositions with bootstrapped confidence intervals and derive potential explanations for the propositions. Results: In this article, we report on the design of the family of surveys, its underlying theory, and the full results obtained from the replication studies conducted in 10 countries with participants from 228 organisations. Our results represent a substantial step forward towards developing an empirical theory of RE practice. The results reveal, for example, that there are no strong differences between organisations in different countries and regions, that interviews, facilitated meetings and prototyping are the most used elicitation techniques, that requirements are often documented textually, that traces between requirements and code or design documents are common, that requirements specifications themselves are rarely changed and that requirements engineering (process) improvement endeavours are mostly internally driven. Conclusion: Our study establishes a theory that can be used as starting point for many further studies for more detailed investigations. Practitioners can use the results as theory-supported guidance on selecting suitable RE methods and techniques."

      "Abstract": "ORIS is a toolbox enabling quantitative evaluation of transient and steady-state measures in stochastic models of concurrent behavior. As a salient and characterizing feature, ORIS supports numerical solution of models with generally distributed timers, possibly limited by firm upper and lower bounds, which break the limits of memoryless Markovian behavior so as to improve models validity through the ability to fit real data and firm timing constraints obtained by design. \nThe toolbox includes functions for creation, validation, and evaluation of models specified through the formalism of Stochastic Time Petri Nets (STPNs), which can be exploited through an interactive GUI or through programmatic access by a Java application. \nORIS provides a robust and well-engineered Java implementation for a suite of advanced numerical solution techniques, which can contribute to the practice of software engineering in multiple directions. On the one hand, ORIS supports engineering and early evaluation of non-functional requirements related to various characteristics, notably including Performance Efficiency, Reliability, and Maintainability. A rich literature of model transformation techniques supports integration of this capability into Model Driven Engineering processes fitting the needs of industrial practice. \nOn the other hand, ORIS functional capabilities can be embedded in software components implementing descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, which in turn can fit in advanced software architectures implementing the concepts of models@runtime and self-adaptation. For example, data analytics components acquiring data on a monitored system (e.g., a software architecture, a fault-tolerant system, a cyber-physical infrastructure) can use ORIS as a Java library to derive quantitative measures of interest (e.g., QoS violations, expected repair times) to tune system parameters and optimize system behavior. \nOver the years, ORIS was tested against a number of different scenarios in both directions, for various application cases including: - Optimal input selection in testing of partially controllable real-time software; - Performability analysis of ERTMS/ETCS railway signaling standards under GSM-R failures; - Verification of real-time software in model-driven development processes based on model transformation from input UML statechart specifications; - Analysis of expected service disruption due to failures in critical infrastructures; - Evaluation of real-time mutual exclusion protocols among concurrent processes. \nOn the ground of this experience, the underlying Java implementation of ORIS was recently released in an open-source distribution, and its overall structural and functional characteristics were reported in a paper that appeared in the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering."

      "Abstract": "This is an extended abstract and presentation proposal for the manuscript ID EMSE-D-18-00360R1 accepted by the Empirical Software Engineering journal. The journal paper is not yet online. The accepted manuscript is uploaded along with this proposal. \nAutomatically predicting the defect type of a software defect from its description can significantly speed up and improve the software defect management process. The standard supervised learning based approach for this task (Thung et al., WCRE2012) needs 90% of labeled data for training the classifier. Creating such data is an expensive and effort-intensive task requiring domain-specific expertise. \nIn this paper, we propose to circumvent this problem by carrying out concept-based classification (CBC) of software defect reports with help of the Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) framework. We first create the concept-based representations of a software defect report and the defect types in the software defect classification scheme by projecting their textual descriptions into a concept-space spanned by the Wikipedia articles. Then, we compute the semantic similarity between these concept-based representations and assign the software defect type that has the highest similarity with the defect report. The proposed CBC approach achieves accuracy (F1 score \u003d 63.16%) similar to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised and active learning approach (Thung et al., , ICPC 2015) for this task without requiring labeled training data. The state-of-the-art approach requires labels for 15% of input defects and achieves accuracy (F1 score) of 62.3%. \nUnlike the state-of-the-art approach, our method does not need access to the source-code used to fix the defect. We use just the textual description of the defect reports and the keywords describing the defect types in the defect classification scheme. Note that learning a classifier without labeled training data is known as zero-shot learning and it is a significantly harder task than learning a classifier using labeled data. The proposed concept-based classification of software defect types is the first instance of zero-shot learning philosophy in the software defect analytics domain."

      "Abstract": "Much research has investigated the common reasons for build breakages. However, prior research has paid little attention to builds that may break due to reasons that are unlikely to be related to development activities. For example, Continuous Integration (CI) builds may break due to timeout or connection errors while generating the build. Such kinds of build breakages potentially introduce noises to build breakage data, which can lead to misleading results when performing research on CI builds. In this paper, we identify three types of noisy build breakages, namely Environmental, Cascading, and Allowed breakages. Our results reveal that over 50% of build breakages can be noisy. Moreover, we measure the impact of using noisy data on modeling the build breakage. We observe that findings from prior research may not hold if noisy build breakages are excluded from datasets. Therefore, researchers should be more careful about the quality of build breakage data."

      "Abstract": "The government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, also referred to by many as “North Korea”) realized the importance of Information and Computing Technology (ICT) and began to establish a master plan for ICT adoption after Kim Il Sung toured eight countries in Eastern Europe in 1984. Kim determined that electronics-related high technology was key to national economic development, and technical cooperation contracts were signed with many of the countries he visited. Moreover, DPRK students were sent to those countries to learn modern technologies. In 1988, a three-year plan for the promotion of science and technology began, and the government began to provide massive funding for information science and industry. In addition, through the International Cooperation Bureau of the State Commission of Science and Technology, the DPRK has been seeking help from UN organizations such as the United Nations Development Program and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. Also, the DPRK signed an MoU with the International Institute for Software Technology of United Nations University on a joint effort for software development. The DPRK has been stressing software sectors more than hardware sectors due to its poor economic situation and various restrictions (such as those imposed by the Wassenaar Agreement, COCOM, and EAR) on the importation of advanced equipment. The software industry does not require a large amount of capital but instead requires good human brains and creativity. In general, young people in the DPRK are very strong in mathematics and basic sciences. In this presentation, the general education system in the DPRK will be briefly described, and this will be followed by a detailed discussion of several aspects of ICT education in the DPRK, including education in secondary schools for gifted students, the establishment of computer technology universities, and ICT education at prestigious universities and research institutions including KISU(Kim Il Sung University), KUT(Kim-Chaek University of Technology), PUST(Pyongyang University of Science and Technology), KCC(Korea Computer Center) and PIC(Pyongyang Informatics Center). The level of software technology in the DPRK is nearly on a par with that of Western countries. The Silver Star Go game developed in 1997 won the first prize in the global computer Go game competition held in Japan in 1998. Since then, the DPRK has won first prize several years in a row. The DPRK government initiated many programs to encourage and improve the DPRK’s software capability. Some of the software products developed in earlier days will be presented, together with those displayed at the DPRK Computer Software Seminar being held in Beijing, China in April, 2002. After the historic meeting of Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong Il in June 2000, inter-Korean collaborations in ICT, in particular those involving technology, had become quite active until the South Korean government halted collaborations on May 24, 2010. Some examples of inter-Korean projects will be described. Finally, a brief introduction to Pyongyang University of Science and Technology and its role in nurturing skilled graduates with global mindsets, in order to lead the DPRK into the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution, will be presented."

      "Abstract": "The Robot Operating System (ROS) is the de-facto standard for robotic software. If on one hand ROS is helping roboticists, e.g., by providing a standardized communication platform, on the other hand ROS-based systems are getting larger and more complex and could benefit from good software architecture practices. This paper presents an observational study aimed at (i) unveiling the state of the practice for architecture of ROS-based systems and (ii) providing guidance to roboticists about how to properly architect ROS-based systems. To achieve these goals, we (i) build a dataset of 335 GitHub repositories containing real open-source ROS-based systems, (ii) mine the repositories for extracting the state of the practice about how roboticists are architecting them, and (iii) synthesize a catalog of 49 evidence-based guidelines for architecting ROS-based systems. The guidelines have been validated by 77 roboticists working on real-world open-source ROS-based systems."

      "Abstract": "Testing cyber-physical system (CPS) development tools such as MathWorks’ Simulink is very important as they are widely used in design, simulation, and verification of CPS data-flow models. Existing randomized differential testing frameworks such as SLforge leverages semi-formal Simulink specifications to guide random model generation which requires significant research and engineering investment along with the need to manually update the tool, whenever MathWorks updates model validity rules. To address the limitations, we propose to learn validity rules automatically by learning a language model using our framework DeepFuzzSL from existing corpus of Simulink models. In our experiments, DeepFuzzSL consistently generate over 90% valid Simulink models and also found 2 confirmed bugs by MathWorks Support."

      "Abstract": "Self-driving cars, or Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are increasingly becoming an integral part of our daily life. About 50 corporations are actively working on AVs, including large companies such as Google, Ford, and Intel. Some AVs are already operating on public roads, with at least one unfortunate fatality recently on record. As a result, understanding bugs in AVs is critical for ensuring their security, safety, robustness, and correctness. While previous studies have focused on a variety of domains (e.g., numerical software; machine learning; and error-handling, concurrency, and performance bugs) to investigate bug characteristics, AVs have not been studied in a similar manner. Recently, two software systems for AVs, Baidu Apollo and Autoware, have emerged as frontrunners in the open-source community and have been used by large companies and governments (e.g., Lincoln, Volvo, Ford, Intel, Hitachi, LG, and the US Department of Transportation). From these two leading AV software systems, this paper describes our investigation of 16,851 commits and 499 AV bugs and introduces our classification of those bugs into 13 root causes, 20 bug symptoms, and 18 categories of software components those bugs often affect. We identify 16 major findings from our study and draw broader lessons from them to guide the research community towards future directions in software bug detection, localization, and repair."

      "Abstract": "Software projects are increasingly forming social-technical ecosystems within which individual projects rely on the infrastructures or functional components provided by other projects, leading to complex inter-dependencies. Through inter-project dependencies, a bug in an upstream project may have profound impact on a large number of downstream projects, resulting in cross-project bugs. The emerging type of bugs has brought new challenges in bug fixing due to their unclear influence on downstream projects. In this paper, we present an approach to estimating the impact of a cross-project bug within its ecosystem by identifying the affected downstream modules (classes/methods). Note that a downstream project that uses a buggy upstream function may not be affected as the usage does not satisfy the failure inducing preconditions. For a reported bug with the known root cause function and failure inducing preconditions, we first collect the candidate downstream modules that call the upstream function through an ecosystem-wide dependence analysis. Then, the paths to the call sites of the buggy upstream function are encoded as symbolic constraints. Solving the constraints, together with the failure inducing preconditions, identifies the affected downstream modules. Our evaluation of 31 existing upstream bugs on the scientific Python ecosystem containing 121 versions of 22 popular projects (with a total of 16 millions LOC) shows that the approach is highly effective: from the 25490 candidate downstream modules that invoke the buggy upstream functions, it identifies 1132 modules where the upstream bugs can be triggered, pruning 95.6% of the candidates. The technique has no false negatives and an average false positive rate of 7.9%. Only 49 downstream modules (out of the 1132 we found) were reported before to be affected."

      "Abstract": "GUI animations, such as card movement, menu slide in/out, snackbar display, provide appealing user experience and enhance the usability of mobile applications. These GUI animations should not violate the platform’s UI design guidelines (referred to as design-don’t guideline in this work) regarding component motion and interaction, content appearing and disappearing, and elevation and shadow changes.However, none of existing static code analysis, functional GUI testing and GUI image comparison techniques can see\u0027\u0027 the GUI animations on the scree, and thus they cannot support the linting of GUI animations against design-don\u0027t guidelines. In this work, we formulate this GUI animation linting problem as a multi-class screencast classification task, but we do not have sufficient labeled GUI animations to train the classifier. Instead, we propose an unsupervised, computer-vision based adversarial autoencoder to solve this linting problem. Our autoencoder learns to group similar GUI animations byseeing\u0027\u0027 lots of unlabeled real-application GUI animations and learning to generate them. As the first work of its kind, we build the datasets of synthetic and real-world GUI animations. Through experiments on these datasets, we systematically investigate the learning capability of our model and its effectiveness and practicality for linting GUI animations, and identify the challenges in this linting problem for future work."

      "Abstract": "Over the last few years, there has been substantial research on automated analysis, testing, and debugging of Ethereum smart contracts. However, it is not trivial to compare and reproduce that research. To address this, we present an empirical evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art automated analysis tools using two new datasets: i) a dataset of 69 annotated vulnerable smart contracts that can be used to evaluate the precision of analysis tools; and ii) a dataset with all the smart contracts in the Ethereum Blockchain that have Soliditysource code available on Etherscan (a total of 47,518 contracts). The datasets are part of SmartBugs, a new extendable execution frame-work that we created to facilitate the integration and comparison between multiple analysis tools and the analysis of Ethereum smart contracts. We used SmartBugs to execute the 9 automated analysis tools on the two datasets. In total, we ran 428,337 analyses that took approximately 564 days and 3 hours, being the largest experimental setup to date both in the number of tools and in execution time. We found that only 42% of the vulnerabilities from our annotated dataset are detected by all the tools, with the toolMythrilhavingthe higher accuracy (27%). When considering the largest dataset, we observed that 97% of contracts are tagged as vulnerable, thus suggesting a considerable number of false positives. Indeed, only a small number of vulnerabilities (and of only two categories) were detected simultaneously by four or more tools."

      "Abstract": "Introductory programming is challenging for many students, requiring them to engage with a deep approach to learning concepts in order to succeed. These challenges compound for online students who do not have direct face-to-face interactions with teaching staff. With the growing demand for online education, we need to examine approaches that assist in building supportive learning environments for these students. A growing body of work from other education disciplines indicates that audio feedback provides an opportunity for developing stronger relationships with students. Further studies recommend an integrated implementation of audio recording into the virtual learning environment. To evaluate audio feedback for use in programming education, we developed an integrated, cross-browser audio feedback feature into the open-source Doubtfire learning management system. Doubtfire is used to support and scale a task-oriented teaching and learning system built upon the principles of constructive alignment and has been shown to help students engage with programming concepts in campus-only units. Our findings from experimental and observational activities indicate that programming tutors can use a blended approach of audio and text feedback via the learning management system to better support student learning. The richer, more nuanced feedback delivery communicates personality to students while retaining the benefits of written feedback for code-specific issues."

      "Abstract": "Program dependence is a fundamental concept to many software engineering tasks, yet the traditional dependence analysis struggles to cope with common modern development practices such as multi-lingual implementations and use of third-party libraries. While Observation-based Slicing (ORBS) solves these issues and produces an accurate slice, it has a scalability problem due to the need to build and execute the target program multiple times. We would like to propose a radical change of perspective: a useful dependence analysis needs to be scalable even if it approximates the dependency. Our goal is a scalable approximate program dependence analysis via estimating the likelihood of dependence. We claim that 1) using external information such as lexical analysis or a development history, 2) learning dependence model from partial observations, and 3) merging static, and observation-based approach would assist the proposition. We expect that our technique would introduce a new perspective of program dependence analysis into the likelihood of dependence. It would also broaden the capability of the dependence analysis towards large and complex software."

Real-world teams are ever-mindful of the practicalities of adding new methods on top of their existing processes. For example, how can they keep the time costs viable? How can they maximize impacts of using it? What about controversies that can arise in talking about gender? To find out how software teams “in the trenches” handle these and similar questions, we collected the GenderMag-based processes of 10 real-world software teams—more than 50 people—for periods ranging from 5 months to 3.5 years. We present these teams’ insights and experiences in the form of 9 practices, 2 potential pitfalls, and 2 open issues, so as to provide their insights to other real-world software teams trying to engineer gender-inclusivity into their software products."

These works often rely on manually identified features, and human effort is required to identify these features for each task. In this work, we propose CC2Vec, a neural network model that learns the representation of code changes guided by their accompanying log messages, which represent the semantic intent of the code changes. CC2Vec models the hierarchical structure of a code change with the help of the attention mechanism and uses multiple comparison functions to represent the differences between the removed and added code. To evaluate if CC2Vec can produce a distributed representation of code changes that is general and useful for multiple tasks on software patches, we use the vectors produced by CC2Vec for three tasks: log message generation, bug fixing patch identification, and just-in-time defect prediction. In all tasks, the models using CC2Vec outperform the state-of-the-art techniques."

      "Abstract": "Regression faults, which make working code stop functioning, are often introduced when developers make changes to the software. As a large number of changes can happen between the original correct version and current regression version, once a regression failure is observed, it is a non-trivial task to (1) isolate the failure-inducing changes and, more importantly, (2) understand how they lead to the final observable failure. Many regression fault localization techniques such as dynamic slicing, delta debugging, and symbolic analysis have been proposed. However, issues like inaccuracy, lack of scalability, and missing explanation are still obstacles for their practical application. \nIn this work, we propose a trace-based approach to identifying not only where the root cause of a regression bug lies, but also how the defect is propagated to its manifestation as the explanation. In our approach, we keep the trace of original correct version as reference and infer the faulty steps on the trace of regression version so that we can build a causality graph of how the defect is propagated. To this end, we overcomes two technical challenges. First, we align two traces derived from two program versions by extending state-of-the-art trace alignment technique for regression fault with novel relaxation technique. We provide theoretical analysis on how our relaxation technique can address the unique challenges to align two program execution traces derived from two versions with non-trivial changes. Second, we construct causality graph (i.e., explanation) by adopting a technique called alignment slicing and mending to isolate the failure-inducing changes and explain the failure. Technically, the explanation is generated by asking why and why-not questions along the traces. \nOur comparative experiment with the state-of-the-art techniques including dynamic slicing, delta-debugging, and symbolic execution on 24 real-world regressions shows that (1) our approach is more accurate on isolating the failure-inducing changes, (2) the generated explanation requires acceptable manual effort to inspect, and (3) our approach requires lower runtime overhead. In addition, we also conduct an applicability experiment based on Defects4J bug repository, empirically validating the potential limitations of our trace-based approach and providing guidance for its practical use. A demo video of our tool is available at https://github.com/llmhyy/tregression. \nTo summarize, we make the following contributions: - Given two traces from two versions of a program, we extend existing trace alignment techniques with a novel relaxation technique to align the executions of two program versions with considerable number of modifications. - We adopt the alignment slicing and mending technique on locating regression bugs, which derives a causality graph including both execution steps and unexecuted modifications to explain the regression failure. - We implement our tool ERASE for both Java and C programs, providing an interactive tool for programmers to explore why a regression failure happens in practice. - We study the effectiveness of our approach on an experiment on 24 real-world C regressions, which demonstrates the effectiveness of ERASE over state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, our applicability experiment on 298 Defects4J bugs allows us to understand the limitation of trace-based approach and provides guidance on its practical use."

Tagging this mixed text is essential for making progress on two seminal software engineering problems - traceability, and reuse via precise extraction of code snippets from mixed text. In this paper, we borrow code-switching techniques from Natural Language Processing and adapt them to apply to mixed text to solve two problems: language identification and token tagging. Our technique, Posit, simultaneously provides abstract syntax tree tags for source code tokens, part-of-speech tags for natural language words, and predicts the source language of a token on mixed text. To realize Posit, we trained a biLSTM network with a Conditional Random Field output layer using abstract syntax tree tags from the CLANG compiler and part-of-speech tags from the Standard Stanford part-of-speech tagger. Posit improves the state-of-the-art on language identification by 10.6% and PoS/AST tagging by 23.7% in accuracy."

      "Abstract": "Screen recordings of mobile applications are easy to obtain and capture a wealth of information pertinent to software developers (e.g., bugs or feature requests), making them a popular technique for crowdsourced app feedback. Thus, these videos are becoming a common artifact that developers must manage. In light of unique mobile development constraints, including swift release cycles and rapidly evolving platforms, automated techniques for analyzing all types of rich software artifacts provide benefit to mobile developers. Unfortunately, automatically analyzing screen recordings presents serious challenges, due to their graphical nature, compared to other types of (textual) artifacts. To address these challenges, this paper introduces V2S, a lightweight, automated approach for translating video recordings of Android app usages into replayable scenarios. V2S is based primarily on computer vision techniques and adapts recent solutions for object detection and image classification to detect and classify user actions captured in a video, and convert these into a replayable test scenario. We performed an extensive evaluation of V2S involving 175 videos depicting 3,534 GUI-based actions collected from users exercising features and reproducing bugs from over 80 popular Android apps. Our results illustrate that V2S can accurately replay scenarios from screen recordings, and reproduces $\\approx$ 89% of our collected videos with minimal overhead. A case study with three industrial partners illustrates the potential usefulness of V2S for developers."

      "Abstract": "Blockchain-related discussions have become increasingly prevalent in programming Q\u0026amp;A websites, such as Stack Overflow and other Stack Exchange communities. Analyzing and understanding those discussions could provide insights about the topics of interest to practitioners, and help the software development and research communities better understand the needs and challenges facing developers as they work in this new domain. Prior studies propose the use of LDA to study the Stack Exchange discussions. However, a simplistic use of LDA would capture the topics in discussions blindly without keeping in mind the variety of the dataset and domain-specific concepts. Specifically, LDA is biased towards larger sized corpora; and LDA-derived topics are not linked to higher level domain-specific concepts. We propose an approach that combines balanced LDA (which ensures that the topics are balanced across a domain) with the reference architecture of a domain to capture and compare the popularity and impact of discussion topics across the Stack Exchange communities. Popularity measures the distribution of interest in discussions, and impact gauges the trend of popularity over time. We made a number of interesting observations, including: (1) Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and Corda are the four most commonly-discussed blockchain platforms on the Stack Exchange communities. (2) A broad range of topics are discussed across the various platforms of distinct layers in our derived reference architecture. (3) The Application layer topics exhibit the highest popularity (33.2%) and fastest growth in topic impact since November 2015. (4) The Application, API, Consensus and Network layer topics are discussed across the studied blockchain platforms, but exhibit different distributions in popularity. (5) The impact of architectural layer topics exhibits an upward trend, but is growing at different speeds across the studied blockchain platforms. The breakdown of the topic impact across the architectural layers is relatively stable over time except for the Hyperledger Fabric platform. Based on our findings, we highlighted future directions and provided recommendations for practitioners and researchers."

      "Abstract": "This paper introduces a new idea for enhancing constraint solvers and decision procedures that are backend engines for many analysis and synthesis techniques that are powerful but have high complexity. Our insight is that in many application scenarios the engines are run repeatedly against input formulas that encode problems that are related but of increasing complexity, and domain-specific knowledge can help mitigate the increase in complexity. Moreover, even for one formula the engine may perform multiple expensive tasks with commonalities that can be estimated and exploited likewise. We believe these relationships lay a foundation for making the engines more effective and their applications more scalable. We illustrate the viability of our idea by applying it in the context of a well-known constraint solver for imperative constraints that has been used for automated testing and quantitative analysis, and discuss how the idea generalizes to more general purpose methods."

      "Abstract": "Misleading names of the methods in a project or the APIs in a software library confuse developers about program functionality and API usages, leading to API misuses and defects. In this paper, we introduce MNIRE, a machine learning approach to check the consistency between the name of a given method and its implementation. MNIRE first generates a candidate name and compares the current name against it. If the two names are sufficiently similar, we consider the method as consistent. To generate the method name, we draw our ideas and intuition from an empirical study on the nature of method names in a large dataset. Our key findings are that high proportions of the tokens of method names can be found in the three contexts of a given method including its body, the interface (the method’s parameter types and return type), and the enclosing class’ name. Even when such tokens are not there, MNIRE uses the contexts to predict the tokens due to the high co-occurrence likelihoods. Our unique idea is to treat the name generation as an abstract summarization on the tokens collected from the names of the program entities in the three above contexts. \nWe conducted several experiments to evaluate MNIRE in method name consistency checking and in method name recommending on large datasets with +14M methods. In detecting inconsistency method names, MNIRE improves the state-of-the-art approach by 10.4% and 11% relatively in recall and precision, respectively. In method name recommendation, MNIRE improves relatively over the state-of-the-art technique, code2vec, in both recall (18.2% higher) and precision (11.1% higher). To assess MNIRE’s usefulness, we used it to detect inconsistent methods and suggest new names in several active, GitHub projects. We made 50 pull requests and received 42 responses. Among them, 5 PRs were merged into the main branch, and 13 were approved for later merging. In total, in 31/42 cases, the developer teams agree that our suggested names are more meaningful than the current names, showing MNIRE’s usefulness."

To get the data processed, one then has to debug the input data—that is, \n \n identify which parts of the input data prevent processing, and \n recover as much of the (valuable) input data as possible. \n \nIn this paper, we present a general-purpose algorithm called ddmax that addresses these problems automatically. Through experiments, ddmax maximizes the subset of the input that can still be processed by the program, thus recovering and repairing as much data as possible; the difference between the original failing input and the “maximized” passing input includes all input fragments that could not be processed. To the best of our knowledge, ddmax is the first approach that fixes faults in the input data without requiring program analysis. In our evaluation, ddmax repaired about 69% of input files and recovered about 78% of data within one minute per input."

      "Abstract": "Existing GUI testing approaches of Android apps usually test apps from a single entry, in this way, the marginal activities far away from the default entry are difficult to be covered. The marginal activities may fail to be launched due to requiring a great number of activity transitions or involving complex user operations, leading to uneven coverage on activity components. Besides, since the test space of GUI programs is infinite, it is difficult to test activities under complete launching contexts using single-entry testing approaches. \nIn this paper, we address these issues by constructing activity launching contexts and proposing a multiple-entry testing framework. We perform an inter-procedural, flow-, context- and path-sensitive analysis to build activity launching models and generate complete launching contexts. By exposing activities, we could launch them directly under various contexts without performing long event sequence on GUI. Besides, to achieve an in-depth exploration and detect more bugs, we design an adaptive exploration framework which supports the multiple-entry exploration and dynamically assigns a weight to each entry. \nOur approach is implemented in a tool called \\textit{Fax}, with an activity launching strategy Fax${la}$ and an exploration strategy Fax${ex}$. The experiments on 20 real-world apps show that Fax${la}$ can successfully launch 68.5% activities, based on which Fax${ex}$ further achieves a relatively 18.0% improvement on method coverage compared with the most popular tool Monkey. Our tool also behaves well in revealing hidden bugs. The number of unique crashes detected by Fax, which is over four hundred, is significantly higher than those of other tools. Among the 45 crashes reported to developers on Github, 24 have been fixed and 4 have been confirmed."

      "Abstract": "Mobile apps are an integral component of our daily life. Ability to use mobile apps is important for everyone, but arguably even more so for approximately 15% of the world population with disabilities. This paper presents the results of a large-scale empirical study aimed at understanding accessibility of Android apps from three complementary perspectives. First, we analyze the prevalence of accessibility issues in over 1,000 Android apps. We find that almost all apps are riddled with accessibility issues, hindering their use by disabled people. We then investigate the developer sentiments through a survey aimed at understanding the root causes of so many accessibility issues. We find that in large part developers are unaware of accessibility design principles and analysis tools, and the organizations in which they are employed do not place a premium on accessibility. We finally investigate user ratings and comments on app stores. We find that due to the disproportionately small number of users with disabilities, user ratings and app popularity are not indicative of the extent of accessibility issues in apps. We conclude the paper with several observations that form the foundation for future research and development."

      "Abstract": "Automated test case generation is an effective technique to yield high-coverage test suites. While the majority of research effort has been devoted to satisfying coverage criteria, a recent trend emerged towards optimizing other non-coverage aspects. In this regard, runtime and memory usage are two essential dimensions: less expensive tests reduce the resource demands for the generation process and later regression testing phases. This study shows that performance-aware test case generation requires solving two main challenges: providing a good approximation of resource usage with minimal overhead and avoiding detrimental effects on both final coverage and fault detection effectiveness. To tackle these challenges, we conceived a set of performance proxies -inspired by previous work on performance testing- that provide a reasonable estimation of the test execution costs (i.e., runtime and memory usage). Thus, we propose an adaptive strategy, called aDynaMOSA, which leverages these proxies by extending DynaMOSA, a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm in unit testing. Our empirical study -involving 110 non-trivial Java classes- reveals that our adaptive approach generates test suite with statistically significant improvements in runtime (-25%) and heap memory consumption (-15%) compared to DynaMOSA. Additionally, aDynaMOSA has comparable results to DynaMOSA over seven different coverage criteria and similar fault detection effectiveness. Our empirical investigation also highlights that the usage of performance proxies (i.e., without the adaptiveness) is not sufficient to generate more performant test cases without compromising the overall coverage."

      "Abstract": "Due to the rapid development of deep neural networks, in recent years, machine translation software has been widely adopted in people’s daily lives, such as communicating with foreigners or understanding political news from the neighbouring countries. However, machine translation software could return incorrect translations because of the complexity of the underlying network. To address this problem, we introduce a novel methodology called PaInv for validating machine translation software. Our key insight is that sentences of different meanings should not have the same translation (i.e., pathological invariance). Specifically, PaInv generates syntactically similar but semantically different sentences by replacing one word in the sentence and filter out unsuitable sentences based on both syntactic and semantic information. We have applied PaInv to Google Translate using 200 English sentences as input with three language settings: English$\\rightarrow$Hindi, English$\\rightarrow$Chinese, and English$\\rightarrow$German. PaInv can accurately find 331 pathological invariants in total, revealing more than 100 translation errors."

      "Abstract": "Many Software Engineering problems such as discovering programming patterns, inferring API specifications, etc, perform source code analysis over the control flow graphs (CFGs) at scale. Analyzing millions of CFGs can be expensive and performance of the analysis heavily depends on the underlying CFG traversal strategy. State-of-the-art analysis frameworks use a fixed traversal strategy. We argue that a single traversal strategy does not fit all kinds of analyses and CFGs and propose bespoke control flow analysis (BCFA). Given a control flow analysis (CFA) and a large number of CFGs, BCFA selects the most efficient traversal strategy for each CFG. BCFA extracts a set of properties of the CFA by analyzing the code of the CFA and combines it with properties of the CFG, such as branching factor and cyclicity, for selecting the optimal traversal strategy. We have implemented BCFA in Boa, and evaluate using a set of representative source code analyses that mainly involve traversing CFGs and two large datasets containing 287 thousand and 162 million CFGs. Our results show that BCFA can speedup the large scale analyses by 1%-28%. We also found that, BCFA has low overheads; less than 0.2%, and low misprediction rate; less than 0.01%."

However, educators often struggle in convincing undergraduate students of their value. Grasping the importance of good software design requires a certain maturity that is not yet attained in the first years of a computer science curriculum. In this study, we introduce group shuffling dynamics to a formal software design course to convey the importance of these concepts by exposing students to the experience of switching groups mid-semester. This grants a whole new perspective on the matter as the cost of managing technical debt is felt when the respective developers leave, and modeling artifacts become pivotal in aiding the incorporation of new team members. This short paper presents our first experience while implementing this methodology and shares our preliminary results derived from a first set of interviews with our students."

      "Abstract": "In contemporary code review, the comments put by reviewers on a specific code change are immediately visible to the other reviewers involved. May this visibility prime new reviewers’ attention (due to the human’s proneness to availability bias), thus biasing the code review outcome? In this study, we investigate this topic by conducting a controlled experiment with 85 developers who perform a code review and a psychological experiment. Although ~70% of participants are assessed to be prone to availability bias, we did not observe a biasing effect due to the existing review comments. Only when reviewers are primed by a comment on a bug that normally is not considered in code review, they are more likely to find another occurrence of this type of bug. Moreover, this priming effect does not influence reviewers’ likelihood of detecting other types of bugs. Our findings suggest that the current code review practice is effective because existing review comments about bugs in code changes are not negative primers, rather positive reminders for bugs that would otherwise be overlooked during code review."

      "Abstract": "Testing of web APIs is nowadays more critical than ever before, as they are the current standard for software integration. A bug in an organization’s web API could have a huge impact both internally (services relying on that API) and externally (third-party applications and end users). Most existing tools and testing approaches require writing tests or instrumenting the system under test (SUT). The main aim of this dissertation is to take web API testing to an unprecedented level of automation and thoroughness. To this end, we plan to apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for the autonomous detection of software failures. Specifically, the idea is to develop intelligent programs (we call them “bots”) capable of generating hundreds, thousands or even millions of test inputs and to evaluate whether the test outputs are correct based on: 1) patterns learned from previous executions of the SUT; and 2) knowledge gained from analyzing thousands of similar programs. Evaluation results of our initial prototype are promising, with bugs being automatically detected in some real-world APIs."

      "Abstract": "Existing intrusive test automation techniques for touch screen applications (e.g., Appium and Sikuli) are difficult to work on many closed systems, such as a GoPro. Being non-intrusive can largely ensure the usability of the test automation techniques. To this end, this paper presents RoScript, a truly non-intrusive test-script-driven robotic testing system for test automation of touch screen applications. RoScript leverages visual test scripts to ex-press GUI actions on a touch screen application and uses a physical robot to drive automated test execution. To reduce the test script creation cost, a non-intrusive computer vision based technique is also introduced in RoScript to automatically record touch screen actions into test scripts from videos of human actions on the device under test. RoScript is applicable to touch screen applications running on almost arbitrary platforms, whatever the underlying operating systems or GUI frameworks are. We conducted experiments applying it to automate the testing of 21 touch screen applications on 6 different devices. The results show that RoScript is highly usable. In the experiments, it successfully automated 104 test scenarios containing over 650 different GUI actions on the subject applications. RoScript accurately per-formed GUI actions on over 90% of the test script executions and accurately recorded about 85% of human screen click actions into test code."

      "Abstract": "Automated Program Repair (APR) is very useful in helping developers in the process of software development and maintenance. Despite recent advances in deep learning (DL), the DL-based APR approaches still have limitations in learning bug-fixing code changes and learning which context of the surrounding source code that certain bug-fixing changes should be made. These limitations lead to incorrect fixing locations or incorrect fixes. In this paper, we introduce DLFix, a two-tier DL model that treats APR as code transformation learning from the prior bug fixes and the surrounding code contexts of the fixes. The first layer is a tree-based RNN model that learns the contexts of bug fixes and its result is used as an additional weighting input for the second layer, which is designed to learn the bug-fixing code transformations. \nWe conducted several experiments to evaluate DLFix in two standard datasets Defects4J, and Bugs.jar, and in a newly built bug datasets with a total of +20K real-world bugs in eight projects. We have compared against a total of 13 state-of-the-art pattern-based APR tools. Our results show that DLFix improves over 11 of them, and is comparable and complementary to the top two pattern-based APR tools in which there are 7 and 11 unique bugs that they cannot detect, respectively, but we can. Importantly, DLFix is fully automated and data-driven, and does not require hard-coding of bug-fixing patterns as in those tools. We compared DLFix against 4 state-of-the-art deep learning based APR models. DLFix is able to fix 2.5 times more bugs than the best performing baseline."

      "Abstract": "Deep learning (DL) applications are becoming increasingly popular. Their reliabilities largely depend on the performance of DL models integrated in these applications. Traditional techniques need to retrain the models or rebuild and redeploy the applications for coping with unexpected conditions beyond the models’ handling capabilities. In this paper, we take a fault tolerance approach, DISSECTOR, to distinguishing those inputs that represent unexpected conditions (beyond-inputs) from normal inputs that are still within the models’ handling capabilities (within-inputs), thus keeping the applications still function with expected reliabilities. The key insight of DISSECTOR is that a DL model should interpret a within-input with increasing confidence, while a beyond-input would probably cause confused guesses in the prediction process. DISSECTOR works in an application-specific way, adaptive to DL models used in applications, and extremely efficiently, scalable to large-size datasets from complex scenarios. The experimental evaluation shows that DISSECTOR outperformed state-of-the-art techniques in the effectiveness (AUC: avg. 0.8935 and up to 0.9894) and efficiency (runtime overhead: only 3.3–5.8 milliseconds). Besides, it also exhibited encouraging usefulness in defensing against adversarial inputs (AUC: avg. 0.9983) and improving a DL model’s actual accuracy in use (up to 16% for CIFAR-100 and 20% for ImageNet)."

      "Abstract": "The users or deployment engineers of a software system can adapt such a system to a wide range of deployment and usage scenarios by changing the value of configuration options, for example by disabling unnecessary features, tweaking performance-related parameters or specifying GUI preferences. However, the literature agrees that the flexibility of such options comes at a price: misconfigured options can lead a software system to crash in the production environment, while even in the absence of such configuration errors, a large number of configuration options makes a software system more complicated to deploy and use. In earlier work, we also found that developers who intend to make their application configurable face 22 challenges that impact their configuration engineering activities, ranging from technical to management-related or even inherent to the domain of configuration engineering. \nIn this paper, we use a prototyping approach to derive and empirically evaluate requirements for tool support able to deal with 13 (primarily technical) configuration engineering challenges. In particular, via a set of interviews with domain experts, we identify 4 requirements by soliciting feedback on an incrementally evolving prototype. The resulting ``Config2Code\u0027\u0027 prototype, which implements the 4 requirements, is then empirically evaluated via a user study involving 55 participants that comprises 10 typical configuration engineering tasks, ranging from the creation, comprehension, refactoring, and reviewing of configuration options to the quality assurance of options and debugging of configuration failures. A configuration framework satisfying the 4 requirements enables developers to perform more accurately and more swiftly in 70% and 60% (respectively) of the configuration engineering tasks than a state-of-the-practice framework not satisfying the requirements. Furthermore, such a framework allows to reduce the time taken for these tasks by up to 94.62%, being slower for only one task."

      "Abstract": "Metamorphic testing (MT) is well known for its ability to alleviate the oracle problem in software testing. The main idea of MT is to test a software system by checking whether each identified metamorphic relation (MR) holds among several executions. This alleviates the need for comparing the actual output and the expected output for individual test cases, and thus addresses the oracle problem. At present, MT has already been successfully applied in various fields. \nWhile MT is receiving more and more attention, some challenging issues still deserve substantial effort to address, such as acquisition of good MRs, effective test case generation, and research on foundation theory of MT. Since MRs play an important role in MT, effective and efficient acquisition of MRs is an essential task. Despite their importance, most MRs are still manually or arbitrarily identified. If MRs cannot be identified systematically, the effective application of MT would be affected. \nIn view of the importance of MRs, METRIC was developed to help software testers identify MRs from a given set of complete test frames (generated using the category-choice framework). Among the existing MR identification techniques, METRIC has the following advantages: (a) wide range of application domains, (b) few restrictions or assumptions, and (c) efficient MR identification process. However, METRIC still has the following limitations: (a) METRIC does not leverage the information of the output domain for MR identification, which may render the identification process less effective. (b) METRIC lacks an effective mechanism for reducing the search space of complete test frames when identifying potential MRs, which could be tedious and inefficient in those complex scenarios. (c) Fault detection effectiveness of MRs identified by METRIC has not been verified by means of experiments. \nTo address these problems, we propose an enhanced MR identification technique, namely METRIC$^{+}$, which significantly improves the efficacy and automation of METRIC by incorporating an output-domain-guided mechanism. METRIC$^{+}$ is not a simple extension of METRIC. It provides (a) systematic guidelines on identifying the fine-grained relations between the input domain and the output domain, which, in turn, improve the effectiveness of MR identification; and (b) a search space reduction mechanism that enhances the efficiency of MR identification. A supporting tool named MR-GEN$^{+}$ has been developed, which automates most steps of MR identification based on METRIC$^{+}$ (available at: http://www.mt4ws.cc/MR-GEN). Two rounds of experiments, involving four real-life specifications, have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of METRIC$^{+}$. The results have confirmed that METRIC$^{+}$ is highly effective and efficient in MR identification. Additional experiments have been performed to compare the fault detection capability of the MRs generated by METRIC$^{+}$ and those by $\\mu$MT (another MR identification technique). The comparison results have confirmed that the MRs generated by METRIC$^{+}$ are highly effective in fault detection."

      "Abstract": "Threat modeling involves the systematic identification and analysis of cybersecurity threats in the context of a specific system. This paper starts from an assessment of its current state of practice, based on interactions with threat modeling professionals. We argue that threat modeling is still at a low level of maturity, and identify the main criteria for successful adoption of a threat modeling approach in practice. Furthermore, we identify a set of key research challenges for aligning threat modeling research to industry practice, thereby raising the technology-readiness levels of the ensuing solutions, approaches, and tools."

      "Abstract": "The performance of software systems (such as speed, memory usage, correct identification rate) tends to be an evermore important concern, often nowadays on par with functional correctness for critical systems.Systematically testing these performance concerns is however extremely difficult, in particular because there exists no theory underpinning the evaluation of a performance test suite, i.e., to tell the software developer whether such a test suite is “good enough” or even whether a test suite is better than another one. This paper proposes to apply Multimorphic testing and empirically assess the effectiveness of performance test suites of software systems coming from various domains. By analogy with mutation testing, our core idea is to leverage the typical configurability of these systems, and to check whether it makes any difference in the outcome of the tests: i.e., are some tests able to “kill” underperforming system configurations? More precisely, we propose a framework for defining and evaluating the coverage of a test suite with respect to a quantitative property of interest. Such properties can be the execution time, the memory usage or the success rate in tasks performed by a software system. This framework can be used to assess whether a new test case is worth adding to a test suite or to select an optimal test suite with respect to a property of interest. We evaluate several aspects of our proposal through 3 empirical studies carried out in different fields: object tracking in videos, object recognition in images, and code generators."

      "Abstract": "Organizations have a variety of options to help their software developers become their most productive selves, from modifying office layouts, to investing in better tools, to cleaning up the source code. But which options will have the biggest impact? Drawing from the literature in software engineering and industrial/organizational psychology to identify factors that correlate with productivity, we designed a survey that asked 622 developers across 3 companies about these productivity factors and about self-rated productivity. Our results suggest that the factors that most strongly correlate with self-rated productivity were non-technical factors, such as job enthusiasm, peer support for new ideas, and receiving useful feedback about job performance. Compared to other knowledge workers, our results also suggest that software developers’ self-rated productivity is more strongly related to task variety and ability to work remotely."

      "Abstract": "Software developers are generally interested in developing better habits to increase their workplace productivity and well-being, but have difficulties identifying concrete goals and actionable strategies to do so. In several areas of life, such as the physical activity and health domain, self-reflection has been shown to be successful at increasing people’s awareness about a problematic behavior, motivating them to define a self-improvement goal, and fostering goal-achievement. We therefore designed a reflective goal-setting study to learn more about developers’ goals and strategies to improve or maintain good habits at work. In our study, 52 professional software developers self-reflected about their work on a daily basis during two to three weeks, which resulted in a rich set of work habit goals and actionable strategies that developers pursue at work. We also found that purposeful, continuous self-reflection not only increases developers’ awareness about productive and unproductive work habits (84.5%), but also leads to positive self-improvements that increase developer productivity and well-being (79.6%). We discuss how tools could support developers with a better trade-off between the cost and value of workplace self-reflection and increase long-term engagement."

      "Abstract": "Web services often impose constraints that restrict the way in which two or more input parameters can be combined to form valid calls to the service, i.e. \\emph{inter-parameter dependencies}. Current web API specification languages like the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) provide no support for the formal description of such dependencies, making it hardly possible to interact with the services without human intervention. We propose specifying and automatically analyzing inter-parameter dependencies in web APIs. To this end, we propose a domain-specific language to describe these dependencies, a constraint programming-aided tool supporting their automated analysis, and an OAS extension integrating our approach and easing its adoption. Together, these contributions open a new range of possibilities in areas such as source code generation and testing."

      "Abstract": "Data-driven defect prediction has become increasingly important in software engineering process. Since it is not uncommon that data from a software project is insufficient for training a reliable defect prediction model, transfer learning that borrows data/konwledge from other projects to facilitate the model building at the current project, namely Cross-Project Defect Prediction (CPDP), is naturally plausible. Most CPDP techniques involve two major steps, i.e., transfer learning and classification, each of which has at least one parameter to be tuned to achieve their optimal performance. This practice fits well with the purpose of automated parameters optimization. However, there is a lack of thorough understanding about what are the impacts of automated parameters optimization on various CPDP techniques. In this paper, we present the first empirical study that looks into such impacts on 62 CPDP techniques, 13 of which are chosen from the existing CPDP literature while the other 49 ones have not been explored before. We build defect prediction models over 20 real-world software projects that are of different scales and characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that: (1) Automated parameter optimization substantially improves the defect prediction performance of 77% CPDP techniques with a manageable computational cost. Thus more efforts on this aspect are required in future CPDP studies. (2) Transfer learning is of ultimate importance in CPDP. Given a tight computational budget, it is more cost-effective to focus on optimizing the parameter configuration of transfer learning algorithms (3) The research on CPDP is far from mature where it is ‘not difficult’ to find a better alternative by making a combination of existing transfer learning and classification techniques. This finding provides important insights about the future design of CPDP techniques."

      "Abstract": "Existing coverage-based fuzzers usually use the individual controlflow graph (CFG) edge coverage to guide the fuzzing process, which has shown great potential in finding vulnerabilities. However, CFG edge coverage is not effective in discovering vulnerabilities such as use-after-free (UaF). This is because, to trigger UaF vulnerabilities, one needs not only to cover individual edges, but also to traverse some long sequence of edges in a particular order, which is challenging for existing fuzzers. To this end, we first propose to model UaF vulnerabilities as typestate properties, then develop a typestate-guided fuzzer, named UAFL, for discovering vulnerabilities violating typestate properties. Given a typestate property, we first perform a static typestate analysis to find operation sequences potentially violating the property. Then, the fuzzing process is guided by the operation sequences in order to progressively generate test cases triggering property violations. In addition, we also adopt the information flow analysis to improve the efficiency of the fuzzing process. We performed a thorough evaluation of UAFL on 14 widely-used real-world programs. The experiment results show that UAFL substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzers, including AFL, AFLFast, FairFuzz, MOpt, Angora and QSYM, interms of the time taken to discover vulnerabilities. We discovered10 previously unknown vulnerabilities, and received 5 new CVEs."

      "Abstract": "Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have been widely discussed on social-technical platforms (e.g., Stack Overflow). Extracting API mentions from such informal software texts is the prerequisite for API-centric search and summarization of programming knowledge. Machine learning based API extraction has demonstrated superior performance than rule-based methods in informal software texts that lack consistent writing forms and annotations. However, machine learning based methods have a significant overhead in preparing training data and effective features. Training a reliable machine learning based API extraction model for a library often requires several hundreds of manually labeled sentences mentioning this library’s APIs. The effort to prepare training data for hundreds of libraries would be prohibitive. Furthermore, it may also be difficult to prepare sufficient high-quality training data for APIs of some less frequently discussed libraries or frameworks. Another related challenge is to select effective features for a machine learning model to recognize a particular library’s APIs. Designers of a machine learning based API extraction model have to manually select the most effective features for different libraries’ APIs. \nIn our paper, we propose a multi-layer neural network-based architecture for API extraction. Our architecture automatically learns character-, word- and sentence-level features from the input texts, thus removing the need for manual feature engineering and the dependence on advanced features (e.g., API gazetteers) beyond the input texts. Our neural architecture is composed of the character-level convolutional neural network (CNN), word-level embeddings, and sentence-level Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network for automatically learning character-, word- and sentence-level features from input texts, respectively. We also propose to adopt transfer learning to adapt a source-library-trained model to a target-library, thus reducing the overhead of manual training-data labeling when the software text of multiple programming languages and libraries need to be processed. \nWe conduct extensive experiments with six libraries of four programming languages which support diverse functionalities and have different API-naming and API-mention characteristics. Our experiments involve three Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib), one Java library (JDBC), one JavaScript library (React), and one C library (OpenGL). We manually label API mentions in 3600 Stack Overflow posts (600 for each library) for the experiments. Our experiments investigate the performance of our neural architecture for API extraction in informal software texts, the importance of different features, the effectiveness of transfer learning. Our results confirm not only the superior performance of our neural architecture than existing machine learning based methods for API extraction in informal software texts, but also the easy-to-deploy characteristic of our neural architecture. \nOur paper makes the following four contributions: \nOur work is the first one to consider not only the performance of machine learning based API extraction methods but also the easy deployment of such methods for the software text of multiple programming languages and libraries. \nWe propose a multi-layer neural architecture to automatically learn to extract effective features from the input texts for API extraction, thus removing the need for manual feature engineering as well as the dependence on features beyond the input texts. \nWe adopt transfer learning to reduce the overhead of manual labeling of the training data of a subject library. We evaluate the effectiveness of transfer learning across libraries and programming languages and analyze the factors that affect its effectiveness. \nWe conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our architecture as a whole as well its components. Our results reveal insights into the design of effective mechanisms for API extraction tasks."

      "Abstract": "Software developers have benefited from various sources of knowledge such as forums, question-and-answer sites, and social media platforms to help them in various tasks. However, extracting software-related knowledge from different platforms involves many challenges. Our work is motivated by the following use cases: (1) We consider a developer who wants to acquire new knowledge based on software-relevant tweets. Developers face challenges while using Twitter, which relate to having to deal with a huge amount of irrelevant tweets produced on Twitter. As the developer has limited time to inspect new tweets, a content aggregator for Twitter data related to software development is essential. More generally, automatic identification of software-relevant tweets will also enable downstream applications such as creation of a specialized Twitter feed for the developer community. (2) We consider a software developer who acts as a content creator and publishes a coding tutorial on YouTube. Viewers can visually follow the instructions provided in the videos and leave a comment that expresses their experience with the video. Digesting information taken from the comments will help the content creator to be more engaged with their audience and improve their future videos. Automatic filtering of relevant comments will enable creators to study feedback provided by viewers more efficiently, and similar to tweets, such filtering can be used to improve downstream analytics tasks, such as detection of common topics among relevant comments. In both platforms mentioned above (Twitter and YouTube comments), sentences are typically short, contain a lot of noise, and may contain non-standard words. In order to address these challenges, we propose SIEVE~\\cite{sulistya2019sieve}, an approach to improve the effectiveness of knowledge extraction tasks by performing cross-platform analysis. Our approach is based on transfer representation learning and word embedding, leveraging information extracted from a source platform which contains rich domain-related content. The information extracted is then used to solve tasks in another platform (considered as target platform) with less domain-related content. We first build a word embedding model as a representation learned from the source platform, and use the model to improve the performance of knowledge extraction tasks in the target platform. We experiment with Software Engineering Stack Exchange and Stack Overflow as source platforms, and two different target platforms, i.e., Twitter and YouTube. We conducted experiments based on the existing datasets provided by Sharma et al. for Twitter, and Poche et al. for YouTube comments. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed cross-platform analysis approach which achieves performance improvements of up to 28% and 10.3% for the first and second use case respectively."

      "Abstract": "Deep learning (DL) systems, though being widely used, still suffer from quality and reliability issues. Researchers have put many efforts to investigate these issues. One promising direction is to leverage uncertainty, an intrinsic characteristic of DL systems when making decisions, to better understand their erroneous behavior. DL system testing is an effective method to reveal potential defects before the deployment into safety- and security-critical applications. Various techniques and criteria have been designed to generate defect-triggers, i.e. adversarial examples (AEs). However, whether these test inputs could achieve a full spectrum examination of DL systems remains unknown and there still lacks understanding of the relation between AEs and DL uncertainty. In this work, we first conduct an empirical study to uncover the characteristics of AEs from the perspective of uncertainty. Then, we propose a novel approach to generate unique inputs that are missed by existing techniques. The generated data are demonstrated to be more effective in revealing defects even for DL systems equipped with defense mechanism. Further, we investigate the usefulness and effectiveness of the data for DL robustness enhancement."

      "Abstract": "Software logging is widely used in practice. Logs have been used for a variety of purposes like debugging, monitoring, security compliance, and business analytics. Instead of directly invoking the standard output functions, developers usually prefer to use logging utilities (LUs) (e.g., SLF4J), which provide additional functionalities like thread-safety and verbosity level support, to instrument their source code. Many of the previous research works on software logging are focused on the log printing code. There are very few works studying the use of LUs, although new LUs are constantly being introduced by companies and researchers. In this paper, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on the use of Java LUs in the wild. We analyzed the use of $3,856$ LUs from $11,194$ projects in GitHub and found that many projects have complex usage patterns for LUs. For example, 75.8% of the \\emph{large}-sized projects have implemented their own LUs in their projects. More than 50% of these projects use at least three LUs. We conducted further qualitative studies to better understand and characterize the complex use of LUs. Our findings show that different LUs are used for a variety of reasons (e.g., internationalization of the log messages). Some projects develop their own LUs to satisfy project-specific logging needs (e.g., defining the logging format). Multiple uses of LUs in one project are pretty common for \\emph{large} and \\emph{very large}-sized projects mainly for context like enabling and configuring the logging behavior for the imported packages. Interviewing with 13 industrial developers showed that our findings are also generally true for industrial projects and are considered as very helpful for them to better configure and manage the logging behavior for their projects."

      "Abstract": "Rust is a promising systems programming language that embraces both high-level memory safety and low-level resource manipulation. However, the dark side of Rust, unsafe Rust, leaves a large security hole as it bypasses the Rust type system in order to support low-level operations. Recently, several real-world memory corruption vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rust’s standard libraries. \nWe present XRust, a new technique that mitigates the security threat of unsafe Rust by ensuring the integrity of data flow from unsafe Rust code to safe Rust code. The cornerstone of XRust is a novel heap allocator that isolates the memory of unsafe Rust from that accessed only in safe Rust, and prevents any cross-region memory corruption. Our design of XRust supports both single- and multi-threaded Rust programs. Our extensive experiments on real-world Rust applications and standard libraries show that XRust is both highly efficient and effective in practice."

      "Abstract": "The mobile market is growing every year, creating a demand for mission-critical and innovative enterprises, and personal applications. This demand implies the need for skills training necessary for students to enter the professional development market. The Innovation, Development and Teaching in Complex Software Environments approach (IDEAS) was developed for the training of mobile developers to meet this need, through an innovative process for student selection, training through the active methodology Challenge Based Learning, software production, and startups creation. The approach was created through action-research applied during two cycles of a real project in a university environment, where 398 students applied for the first cycle, of which 110 were selected, and 900 applied for the second cycle, of which 100 were selected. We undertook evaluations with students and teachers through periodic reflections, questionnaires, and interviews at the end of each cycle. Some of the positive results included the prominence of 125 professional-looking apps that were finalized and published, report of dropout reduction and disapproval in the programming courses and experience in entrepreneurship and pre-acceleration startup program."

      "Abstract": "A software system’s design determines many of its properties, such as maintainability and performance. To uphold desired properties in a system, developers must be aware of its design. When developers are not aware of a system’s design, choices they make can erode desired system properties [1]. Unfortunately, developers often do not have access to in- formation about a system’s current design. One approach that has been investigated to solve this issue is to recover design automatically from projects artifacts [2]. Most of the existing approaches focus on how a system works by extracting struc- tural (e.g., [3]) and behaviour (e.g., [4]) information, rather than information about the desired design properties, such as robustness or performance. Recently, Brunet et al. and Tsay et al. have identified that developer discussions, captured in project artifacts, such as issue reports, include discussions of design [5], [6]. Tsay et al. have further showed that these discussions can be a major factor in deciding how a system evolves, suggesting that the discussions include information that goes beyond how a system works to explain why certain choices were made. In this paper, we explore whether it is possible to locate automatically where design is discussed in on-line developer discussions. We introduce a classifier that can locate para- graphs in pull request discussions that pertain to design with an average AUC score of 0.87. We show that this classifier, when applied to projects on which it was not trained, agrees with the identification of design points by humans with an average AUC score of 0.79. We finally describe how this classifier could be used as the basis of tools to improve such tasks as reviewing code and implementing new features. This paper shows that there is useful design information latent in on-line developer discussion and provides a means to locate this information at a coarse granularity. Future research can determine how to locate more specific and nuanced design information and investigate how to semantically model the information to produce even more useful tools for developers."

      "Abstract": "Significant interest in applying Deep Neural Network (DNN) has fueled the need to support engineering of software that uses DNNs. Repairing software that uses DNNs is one such unmistakable SE need where automated tools could be very helpful; however, we do not fully understand challenges to repairing and patterns that are utilized when manually repairing them. What challenges should automated repair tools address? What are the repair patterns whose automation could help developers? Which repair patterns should be assigned a higher priority for automation? This work presents a comprehensive study of bug fix patterns to address these questions. We have studied 415 repairs from StackOverflow and 555 repairs from GitHub for five popular deep learning libraries Caffe, Keras, TensorFlow, Theano, and Torch to understand challenges in repairs and bug repair patterns. Our key findings reveal that DNN bug fix patterns are distinctive compared to traditional bug fix patterns; the most common bug fix patterns are fixing data dimension and neural network connectivity; DNN bug fixes have the potential to introduce adversarial vulnerabilities; DNN bug fixes frequently introduce new bugs; and DNN bug localization, reuse of trained model, and coping with frequent releases are major challenges faced by developers when fixing bugs. We also contribute a benchmark of 667 DNN (bug, repair) instances."

      "Abstract": "According to the World Health Organization(WHO), it is estimated that approximately 1.3 billion people live with some form of vision impairment globally, of whom 36 million are blind. Due to their disability, engaging these minority into the society is a challenging problem. The recent rise of smart mobile phones provides a new solution by enabling blind users’ convenient access to the information and service for understanding the world. Users with vision impairment can adopt the screen reader embedded in the mobile operating systems to read the content of each screen within the app, and use gestures to interact with the phone. However, the prerequisite of using screen readers is that developers have to add natural-language labels to the image-based components when they are developing the app. Unfortunately, more than 77% apps have issues of missing labels, according to our analysis of 10,408 Android apps. Most of these issues are caused by developers’ lack of awareness and knowledge in considering the minority. And even if developers want to add the labels to UI components, they may not come up with concise and clear description as most of them are of no visual issues. To overcome these challenges, we develop a deep-learning based model to automatically predict the labels of image-based buttons by learning from large-scale commercial apps in Google Play. The experiment results show that our model can make accurate predictions and the generated labels are of higher quality than that from real Android developers. We also submit our predicted labels of buttons of some apps to their development teams, and successfully get some positive feedback."

      "Abstract": "Many projects often receive more bug reports than what they can handle. To help debug and close bug reports, a number of bug localization techniques have been proposed. These techniques analyze a bug report and return a ranked list of potentially buggy source code files. Recent development on bug localization has resulted in the construction of effective supervised approaches that use historical data of manually localized bugs to boost performance. Unfortunately, as highlighted by Zimmermann et al., sufficient bug data is often unavailable for many projects and companies. This raises the need for cross-project bug localization – the use of data from a project to help locate bugs in another project. To fill this need, we propose a deep transfer learning approach for cross-project bug localization. Our proposed approach named TRANP-CNN extracts transferable semantic features from source project and fully exploits labeled data from target project for effective cross-project bug localization. We have evaluated TRANP-CNN on curated high-quality bug datasets and our experimental results show that TRANP-CNN can locate buggy files correctly at top 1, top 5, and top 10 positions for 29.9%, 51.7%, 61.3% of the bugs respectively, which significantly outperform state-of-the-art bug localization solution based on deep learning and several other advanced alternative solutions considering various standard evaluation metrics."

Both fault localisation and defect prediction aim to locate faults: fault localisation aims to locate faults after they are revealed while defect prediction aims to locate yet- to-happen faults. Despite sharing a similar goal, fault localisation and defect prediction have been studied as separate topics, mainly due to the difference in available data to exploit. In our doctoral research, we aim to bridge fault localisation and defect prediction. Our work is divided into three parts: 1) applying defect prediction to fault localisation, i.e., DP2FL, 2) applying fault localisation to defect prediction, i.e., FL2DP, 3) consecutive application of DP2FL and FL2DP in a single framework. We expect the synergy between fault localisation and defect prediction not only to improve the accuracy of each process but to allow us to build a single model that gradually improve the overall software quality throughout the entire software development life-cycle."

      "Abstract": "Large scale cloud services use Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for tracking and monitoring performance. They usually have Service Level Objectives (SLOs) baked into the customer agreements which are tied to these KPIs. Dependency failures, code bugs, infrastructure failures, and other problems can cause performance regressions. It is critical to minimize the time and manual effort in diagnosing and triaging such issues to reduce customer impact. Large volumes of logs and mixed type of attributes (categorical, continuous) make any automated or manual diagnosis non-trivial. \nThis work presents the design, implementation and experience from building and deploying DeCaf, a system for automated diagnosis and triaging of KPI issues using service logs. It uses machine learning along with pattern mining to help service owners automatically root cause and triage performance issues. We present the learnings and results from case studies on two large scale cloud services at Microsoft where DeCaf has successfully diagnosed 10 known and 31 unknown issues so far. DeCaf also automatically triages the identified issues by leveraging historical data. Our key insights are that for any such diagnosis tool to be effective in practice, it should a) scale to large volumes of service logs and attributes, b) support different types of KPIs and ranking functions, c) be integrated into the DevOps processes."

      "Abstract": "In modern software engineering, developers have to work with constantly evolving, interconnected software systems. Understanding how and why these systems and their dependencies between each other change is therefore an essential step in improving or maintaining them. For this, it is important to know what changed and how these changes influence the system. Most currently used tools that help developers to understand source code changes either use the textual representation of source code, allowing for a coarse-grained overview, or use the AST (abstract syntax tree) representation of source code to extract more fine-grained changes. We plan to improve the accuracy and classification of the extracted source code changes and to extend them by analysing the fine-grained changes of source code dependencies. We also propose a dynamical analysis of the impact of the previously extracted changes on performance metrics. This helps to understand what changes caused a certain change in program behaviour. We plan to use and combine this information to generate accurate and detailed change overviews that bridge the gap between existing coarse-grained solutions and the raw changes contained in the code, aiming to reduce the developers’ time spent reading changed code and help them to quickly understand the changes between two versions of source code."

However, keeping such divergent downstream forks in sync with the upstream source evolution poses engineering challenges in terms of frequent merge conflicts. In this paper, we conduct the first industrial case study of the implications of frequent merges from upstream and the resulting merge conflicts, in the context of Microsoft Edge development. The study consists of two parts. First, we describe the nature of merge conflicts that arise due to merges from upstream and classify them into textual conflicts, build breaks, and test failures. Second, we investigate the feasibility of automatically fixing a class of merge conflicts related to build breaks that consume a significant amount of developer time to root-cause and fix. Towards this end, we have implemented a tool MrgBldBrkFixer and evaluate it on three months of real Microsoft Edge Beta development data, and report encouraging results."

      "Abstract": "Bottom-up program analysis has been traditionally easy to parallelize because functions without caller-callee relations can be analyzed independently. However, such function-level parallelism is significantly limited by the calling dependence – functions with caller-callee relations have to be analyzed sequentially because the analysis of a function depends on the analysis results, a.k.a., function summaries, of its callees. We observe that the calling dependence can be relaxed in many cases and, as a result, the parallelism can be improved. \nIn this paper, we present Cheetah, a framework of bottom-up data flow analysis, in which the analysis task of each function is elaborately partitioned into multiple sub-tasks to generate pipelineable function summaries. These sub-tasks are pipelined and run in parallel without any additional synchronization, even though the calling dependence exists. We formalize our idea under the IFDS/IDE framework and have implemented an application to checking null-dereference bugs in C/C++ programs. \nWe evaluate Cheetah on a series of standard benchmark programs and open-source projects, which demonstrates significant speedup over a conventional parallel design."

Many devices are configured to upload crash reports should the app crash for any reason. Engineers monitor and triage millions of crash reports logged each day to check for bugs, regressions, and any other quality problems. Debugging groups of crashes is a manually intensive process that requires deep domain expertise and close inspection of traces and code, often under time constraints. \nWe use contrast set mining, a form of discriminative pattern mining, to learn what distinguishes one group of crashes from another. Prior works focus on discretization to apply contrast mining to continuous data. We propose the first direct application of contrast learning to continuous data, without the need for discretization. We also define a weighted anomaly score that unifies continuous and categorical contrast sets while mitigating bias, as well as uncertainty measures that communicate confidence to developers. We demonstrate the value of our novel statistical improvements by applying it on a challenging dataset, user navigation event sequences."

      "Abstract": "Automatic test generation typically aims to generate inputs that explore new paths in the program under test in order to find bugs. Existing work has, therefore, focused on guiding the exploration toward program parts that are more likely to contain bugs by using an offline static analysis. \nIn this paper, we introduce a novel technique for targeted greybox fuzzing using an online static analysis that guides the fuzzer toward a set of target locations, for instance, located in recently modified parts of the program. This is achieved by first semantically analyzing each program path that is explored by an input in the fuzzer’s test suite. The results of this analysis are then used to control the fuzzer’s specialized power schedule, which determines how often to fuzz inputs from the test suite. We implemented our technique by extending a state-of-the-art, industrial fuzzer for Ethereum smart contracts and evaluate its effectiveness on 27 real-world benchmarks. Using an online analysis is particularly suitable for the domain of smart contracts since it does not require any code instrumentation—adding instrumentation to contracts changes their semantics. Our experiments show that targeted fuzzing significantly outperforms standard greybox fuzzing for reaching 83% of the challenging target locations (up to 14x of median speed-up)."

Although human errors may cause higher risks, failures of autonomous systems are more strongly perceived by the general population, which hinders the adoption of autonomous safety-critical systems. It is, therefore, necessary to devise approaches for systematically building trust in autonomous functions and thereby facilitate the adoption process. In this paper, we introduce a method and a framework for incremental building of trust in the context of autonomous driving. Within the envisioned solution, we employ the psychological narrative behind trust-building through the formation of new habits and we introduce a method where trust is established gradually for both the human and the autonomous safety-critical system via reputation building and step-by-step integration of smart software agents replacing human actions."

      "Abstract": "Coverage-based greybox fuzzing (CGF) is one of the most successful approaches for automated vulnerability detection. Given a seed file (as a sequence of bits), a CGF randomly flips, deletes or copies some bits to generate new files. CGF iteratively constructs (and fuzzes) a seed corpus by retaining those generated files which enhance coverage. However, random bitflips are unlikely to produce valid files (or valid chunks in files), for applications processing complex file formats. In this work, we introduce smart greybox fuzzing (SGF) which leverages a high-level structural representation of the seed file to generate new files. We define innovative mutation operators that work on the virtual file structure rather than on the bit level which allows SGF to explore completely new input domains while maintaining file validity. We introduce a novel validity-based power schedule that enables SGF to spend more time generating files that are more likely to pass the parsing stage of the program, which can expose vulnerabilities much deeper in the processing logic. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of SGF. On several libraries that parse complex chunk-based files, our tool AFLSmart achieves substantially more branch coverage (up to 87% improvement) and exposes more vulnerabilities than baseline AFL. Our tool AFLSmart discovered 42 zero-day vulnerabilities in widely-used, well-tested tools and libraries; 22 CVEs were assigned."

Many of those chat communications contain valuable information, such as code descriptions, good programming practices, and causes of common errors/exceptions. However, the nature of chat community content is transient, as opposed to the archival nature of other developer communications such as email, bug reports and Q\u0026amp;A forums. As a result, important information and advice are lost over time. \nThe focus of this dissertation is Extracting Archival Information from Software-Related Chats, specifically to (1) automatically identify conversations which contain archival-quality information, (2) accurately reduce the granularity of the information reported as archival information, and (3) conduct a case study to investigate how archival quality information extracted from chats compare to related posts in Q\u0026amp;A forums. Archiving knowledge from developer chats that could be used potentially in several applications such as: creating a new archival mechanism available to a given chat community, augmenting Q\u0026amp;A forums, or facilitating the mining of specific information and improving software maintenance tools."

Recent results on software side-channel detection focus on analysis of program’s source code. However, runtime behavior, in particular optimizations introduced during just-in-time (JIT) compilation, can impact or even introduce timing side channels in programs. In this paper, we present a technique for automatically detecting such JIT-induced timing side channels in Java programs. We first introduce patterns to detect partitions of secret input potentially separable by side channels. Then we present an automated approach for exploring behaviors of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to identify states where timing channels separating these partitions arise. We evaluate our technique on three datasets used in recent work on side-channel detection. We find that many code variants labeled ``safe\u0027\u0027 with respect to side-channel vulnerabilities are in fact vulnerable to JIT-induced timing side channels. Our results directly contradict the conclusions of four separate state-of-the-art program analysis tools for side-channel detection and demonstrate that JIT-induced side channels are prevalent and can be detected automatically."

      "Abstract": "Open Source Software (OSS) has come to play a critical role in the software industry. Some large ecosystems enjoy participation of large numbers of companies, each of which has its own focus and goals. Indeed, companies that otherwise compete, may become collaborators within the OSS ecosystem they participate in. Prior research has largely focused on firm involvement in OSS projects, but there is a scarcity of research focusing on company collaborations within OSS ecosystems. Some of these ecosystems have become critical building blocks for organizations worldwide; hence, a clear understanding of how companies collaborate within large ecosystems is essential. This paper presents the results of an empirical study of the OpenStack ecosystem, in which hundreds of companies collaborate on thousands of project repositories in order to deliver cloud distributions. Based on a detailed analysis, we identify clusters of collaborations, and identify four strategies that companies adopt to engage with the OpenStack ecosystem. We also find that companies may engage in intentional or passive collaborations, or may work in an isolated fashion. Further, we find that a company’s position in the collaboration network is positively associated with its productivity in OpenStack. Our study sheds light on how large OSS ecosystems work, and in particular on the patterns of collaboration within one such large ecosystem."

In this paper, we first summarized 6 categories of migration and proposed an approach to find out where and what types of changes have happened. In order to make mapping relationship with any omission, we designed a function call graph structure to ensure accuracy and compared it with migration situation via analyzing different versions of ABI. We developed a automated tool to implement our approach in a real-world DApp and acquired effective results which precisely shown the migration categories and needed revising hints."

      "Abstract": "Context: With the aim of increasing the reliability and generalizability of individual experiment results, software engineering (SE) researchers from different groups and institutions typically collaborate to perform groups of experiments by means of replication (i.e., conduct groups of replications). However, disparate aggregation techniques are being applied to analyze groups of replications: narrative synthesis, aggregated data, mega-trial individual participant data (IPD-MT), stratified individual participant data (IPD-S), and aggregation of p-values. The application of unsuitable techniques to aggregate replication results may undermine the potential of groups of replications to provide in-depth insights from experiment results. \nObjectives: Provide an analysis procedure with a set of embedded guidelines to aggregate the results of groups of SE replications. \nMethod: First, we compare the characteristics of groups of replications for SE and other mature experimental disciplines such as medicine and pharmacology and identify their differences. Then, we identify four major limitations regarding joint data analysis practices in groups of SE replications: - Limitation 1: Narrative synthesis and aggregation of p-values are used in 53% of groups of SE replications. - Limitation 2: IPD-MT is used in 33% of groups of SE replications. - Limitation 3: AD is used in 38% of groups of SE replications. - Limitation 4: SE researchers rarely acknowledge the limitations of the exploratory analyses that they undertake for identifying moderators. \nNext, we study the guidelines provided in mature experimental disciplines to analyze groups of replications. With all this, we develop an analysis procedure with a set of embedded guidelines specifically tailored to the analysis of groups of SE replications. We apply the proposed analysis procedure to a representative group of SE replications to illustrate its use. \nResults: We propose the adoption of a four-step procedure to analyze groups of SE replications: - Step 1. Describe participants. The objectives of this step are: describe the population to which the results should be generalized, and suggest plausible sources of heterogeneity that may arise when providing joint results. - Step 2. Analyze individual replications. The objectives of this step are: provide descriptive statistics to ease the incorporation of results into prospective studies, identify patterns across replication results, and ensure that statistical heterogeneity is not introduced by the different methods used to analyze the replications. - Step 3. Aggregate the results. The objective of this step is to increase the reliability of joint conclusions. Three guidelines are proposed, specifically tailored to address limitations 1-3: * Guideline 1: Avoid narrative synthesis and aggregation of p-values to provide joint conclusions. * Guideline 2: Avoid IPD-MT due to its potential to provide biased or underpowered results. * Guideline 3: Use AD and IPD-S. - Step 4. Conduct exploratory analyses. The objective of this step is to identify experiment-level and participant-level moderators that may be behind the statistical heterogeneity commonly present in groups of SE replications. Three additional guidelines are proposed to address limitation 4: * Guideline 4: Use AD and IPD-S to identify experiment-level moderators. * Guideline 5: Use IPD-S to identify participant-level moderators. * Guideline 6: Acknowledge limitations of exploratory analyses. \nConclusion: The aggregation techniques used to analyze groups of replications should be justified in research articles. The statistical models and the raw data that used should also be transparently reported. This will increase the reliability and transparency of joint results. The proposed guidelines should ease this endeavor."

      "Abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles. Recently, DNN testing has been intensively studied to automatically generate adversarial examples, which inject small-magnitude perturbations into inputs to test DNNs under extreme situations. While existing testing techniques prove to be effective, particularly for autonomous driving, they mostly focus on generating digital adversarial perturbations, e.g., changing image pixels, which may never happen in the physical world. Thus, there is a critical missing piece in the literature on autonomous driving testing: understanding and exploiting both digital and physical adversarial perturbation generation for impacting steering decisions. In this paper, we propose a systematic physical-world testing approach, namely DeepBillboard, targeting at a quite common and practical driving scenario: drive-by billboards. DeepBillboard is capable of generating a robust and resilient printable adversarial billboard test, which works under dynamic changing driving conditions including viewing angle, distance, and lighting. The objective is to maximize the possibility, degree, and duration of the steering-angle errors of an autonomous vehicle driving by our generated adversarial billboard. We have extensively evaluated the efficacy and robustness of DeepBillboard by conducting both experiments with digital perturbations and physical-world case studies. The digital experimental results show that DeepBillboard is effective for various steering models and scenes. Furthermore, the physical case studies demonstrate that DeepBillboard is sufficiently robust and resilient for generating physical-world adversarial billboard tests for real-world driving under various weather conditions, being able to mislead the average steering angle error up to 26.44 degrees. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the possibility of generating realistic and continuous physical-world tests for practical autonomous driving systems; moreover, DeepBillboard can be directly generalized to a variety of other physical entities/surfaces along the curbside, e.g., a graffiti painted on a wall."

      "Abstract": "Programs tend to provide a broad range of features, and different typologies of users tend to use only a subset of these features. For this reason, and because unnecessary functionality can be harmful in terms of both performance and security, recently we have witnessed an increasing interest in debloating techniques—techniques for reducing the size of a program by eliminating (possibly) unneeded features. Most existing debloating techniques tend to focus on program-size reduction alone, by producing a reduced program that behaves correctly for a provided set of inputs. Although effective with respect to their stated goal, these approaches ignore other important aspects of debloating and ultimately solve a simplified formulation of the problem. We believe that program debloating is a multifaceted issue, in which different, possibly conflicting goals must be considered and suitably accounted for. In this spirit, we propose a general approach that allows for formulating program debloating as a multi-objective optimization problem. Given a program to be debloated, our approach lets users specify (1) a usage profile for the program (i.e., a set of inputs with associated usage probabilities), (2) the factors of interest for the debloating task at hand, and (3) the relative importance of these factors. Based on this information, the approach defines a suitable objective function, so as to be able to associate a score to every possible reduced program, and tries to generate an optimal solution, that is, one that maximizes the objective function. To provide concrete evidence of the usefulness of our approach, we also present and evaluate Debop, a specific instance of the approach that considers three objectives: size reduction, attack surface reduction, and generality (i.e., extent to which the reduced program behaves correctly for the inputs in p’s usage profile). Our results, albeit still preliminary, are promising, in that they show that our approach can be effective in generating debloated programs that achieve good trade-offs between the different factors involved in the debloating process. Our results also provide insights on the performance of our general approach when compared to a specialized single-goal technique."

      "Abstract": "Despite their growing popularity, apps tend to contain defects which can ultimately manifest as failures (or crashes) to end-users. Different automated tools for testing Android apps have been proposed in order to improve software quality. Although Genetic Algorithms and Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) have been promising in recent years, in light of recent results, it seems they are not yet fully tailored to the problem of Android test generation. Thus, this thesis aims to design and evaluate algorithms for alleviating the burden of testing Android apps. In particular, I plan to investigate which is the best search-based algorithm for this particular problem. As the thesis advances, I expect to develop a fully open-source test case generator for Android applications that will serve as a framework for comparing different algorithms. These algorithms will be compared by means of statistical analysis and by using both open-source (i.e., from F-Droid) and commercial applications (i.e., from Google Play Store)."

      "Abstract": "Software defect prediction aims to automatically locate defective code modules to better focus testing resources and human effort. Typically, software defect prediction pipelines are comprised of two parts: the first extracts program features, like abstract syntax trees, by using external tools, and the second applies machine learning-based classification models to those features in order to predict defective modules. Since such approaches depend on specific feature extraction tools, machine learning classifiers have to be custom-tailored to effectively build most accurate models. To bridge the gap between deep learning and defect prediction, we propose an end-to-end framework which can directly get prediction results for programs without utilizing feature-extraction tools. To that end, we first visualize programs as images, apply the self-attention mechanism to extract image features, use transfer learning to reduce the difference in sample distribution between projects, and finally feed the image files into a pre-trained deep learning model for defect prediction. Experiments with 10 open source projects from the PROMISE dataset show that our method can improve cross-project and within-project defect prediction. Our code and data pointers are available at https://zenodo.org/record/3373409#.XV0Oy5Mza35."

      "Abstract": "Defect prediction is an important task for preserving software quality. Most prior work on defect prediction uses software features, such as the number of lines of code, to predict whether a file or commit will be defective in the future. There are several reasons to keep the number of features that are used in a defect prediction model small. For example, using a small number of features avoids the problem of multicollinearity and the so-called `curse of dimensionality’. Feature selection and reduction techniques can help to reduce the number of features in a model. Feature selection techniques reduce the number of features in a model by selecting the most important ones, while feature reduction techniques reduce the number of features by creating new, combined features from the original features. Several recent studies have investigated the impact of feature \\emph{selection} techniques on defect prediction. However, there do not exist large-scale studies in which the impact of multiple feature \\emph{reduction} techniques on defect prediction is investigated. \nIn this paper [1], we study the impact of eight feature reduction techniques on the performance and the variance in performance of five supervised learning and five unsupervised defect prediction models. In addition, we compare the impact of the studied feature reduction techniques with the impact of the two best-performing feature selection techniques (according to prior work). \nThe following findings are the highlights of our study: (1) The studied correlation and consistency-based feature selection techniques result in the best-performing supervised defect prediction models, while feature reduction techniques using neural network-based techniques (restricted Boltzmann machine and autoencoder) result in the best-performing unsupervised defect prediction models. In both cases, the defect prediction models that use the selected/generated features perform better than those that use the original features (in terms of AUC and performance variance). (2) Neural network-based feature reduction techniques generate features that have a small variance across both supervised and unsupervised defect prediction models. Hence, we recommend that practitioners who do not wish to choose a best-performing defect prediction model for their data use a neural network-based feature reduction technique."

      "Abstract": "The amount of open-source-software (OSS) used in the global software engineering community is enormous and growing at an exponential pace. This includes both the products we develop and the development tools we use to create them. It is meanwhile rare to find examples of products that do not contain open source components. Although, using open source components in products does have many advantages, it is very important that one also manages the use of the open source components in a license compliant way. A set of companies and other organizations who either offer or use OSS-based license compliance tools have recently formed the “Open Source Tooling Group”. This international group works on establishing an ecosystem of OSS-based tools for license compliance that fit together well and can offer an end-to-end solution for organizations who want to use these tools to fulfill their license compliance obligations. This talk provides the motivation and overview of this topic describing the relevance to both software engineering practitioners. It will close by highlighting some of the research areas where further improvements could be done in this fast-growing field."

      "Abstract": "Test-to-code traceability links model the relationships between test artefacts and code artefacts. When utilised during the development process, these links help developers to keep test code in sync with tested code, reducing the rate of test failures and missed faults. Test-to-code traceability links can also help developers to maintain an accurate mental model of the system, reducing the risk of architectural degradation when making changes. However, establishing and maintaining these links manually places an extra burden on developers and is error-prone. This paper presents TCtracer, an approach and implementation for the automatic establishment of test-to-code traceability links. Unlike existing work, TCtracer operates at both the method level and the class level, allowing us to establish links between tests and functions, as well as between test classes and tested classes. We improve over existing techniques by combining an ensemble of new and existing techniques and exploiting a synergistic flow of information between the method and class levels. We perform an evaluation of TCtracer using four large, well-studied open source systems which demonstrates that, on average, we can establish test-to-function links with a mean average precision (MAP) of 78% and test-class-to-class links with an MAP of 93%."

      "Abstract": "This paper presents a large-scale study that investigates the bug resolution characteristics among popular Github projects written in different programming languages. We explore correlations but, of course, we cannot infer causation. Specifically, we analyse bug resolution data from approximately 70 million Source Line of Code, drawn from 3 million commits to 600 GitHub projects, primarily written in 10 programming languages. We find notable variations in apparent bug resolution time and patch (fix) size. While interpretation of results from such large-scale empirical studies is inherently difficult, we believe that the differences in medians are sufficiently large to warrant further investigation, replication, re-analysis and follow up research. For example, in our corpus, the median apparent bug resolution time (elapsed time from raise to resolve) for Ruby was 4X that for Go and 2.5X for Java. We also found that patches tend to touch more files for the corpus of strongly typed and for statically typed programs. However, we also found evidence for a lower elapsed resolution time for bug resolution committed to projects constructed from statically typed languages. These findings, if replicated in subsequent follow on studies, may shed further empirical light on the debate about the importance of static typing."

      "Abstract": "In Continuous Integration (CI), regression testing is constrained by the time between commits. This demands for careful selection and/or prioritization of test cases within test suites that are too large to be run entirely. To this aim, some Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been proposed, as an alternative to deterministic approaches. Two broad strategies for ML-based prioritization are learning-to-rank and what we call ranking-to-learn (i.e., reinforcement learning). Various ML algorithms can be applied in each strategy. In this paper we introduce ten of such algorithms for adoption in CI practices, and perform a comprehensive study comparing them against each other using subjects from the Apache Commons project. We analyze the influence of several features of the code under test and of the test process. The results allow to draw criteria to support testers in selecting and tuning the technique that best fits their context."

We present Causal Testing, a new method of root-cause analysis that relies on the theory of counterfactual causality to identify a set of executions that likely hold key causal information necessary to understand and repair buggy behavior. Using the Defects4J benchmark, we find that Causal Testing could be applied to 71% of real-world defects, and for 77% of those, it can help developers identify the root cause of the defect. A controlled experiment with 37 developers shows that Causal Testing improves participants’ ability to identify the cause of the defect from 80% of the time with standard testing tools to 86% of the time with Causal Testing. The participants report that Causal Testing provides useful information they cannot get using tools such as JUnit.

      "Abstract": "Modern JavaScript applications extensively depend on third-party libraries. Especially for the Node.js platform, vulnerabilities can have severe consequences to the security of applications, resulting in, for example, cross-site scripting and command-line injection vulnerabilities. Existing static analysis tools that have been developed to detect such issues automatically are either too coarse, looking only at package dependency structure while ignoring dataflow, or rely on manually-written taint specifications for the most popular libraries to ensure analysis scalability. In this work, we propose a technique for automatically extracting taint specifications for JavaScript libraries, based on a dynamic analysis that leverages the existing test suites of the libraries and their available clients in the npm repository. Due to the dynamic nature of JavaScript, mapping observations from dynamic analysis to taint specifications that fit into a static analysis is nontrivial. Our main insight is that this challenge can be addressed by a combination of an access path mechanism to name entry and exit points and the use of membranes around the libraries of interest. We show that our approach is effective at inferring useful taint specifications at scale. Our prototype tool automatically extracts 146 additional taint sinks and 7,840 propagation summaries spanning 1,393 npm modules. By integrating the extracted specifications in a commercial, state-of-the-art static analysis, 136 new alerts are produced, many of which correspond to likely security vulnerabilities. Moreover, many important specifications that were originally manually written are among the ones that our tool can now extract automatically."

      "Abstract": "Context: Managing Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) in software projects is challenging, and projects that adopt Model-Driven Development (MDD) are no exception. Although several methods and techniques have been proposed to face this challenge, there is still little evidence on how NFRs are handled in MDD by practitioners. Knowing more about the state of the practice may help researchers to steer their research and practitioners to improve their daily work. Objective: In this paper, we present our findings from an interview-based survey conducted with practitioners working in 18 different companies from 6 European countries. From a practitioner’s point of view, the paper shows what barriers and benefits the management of NFRs as part of the MDD process can bring to companies, how NFRs are supported by MDD approaches, and which strategies are followed when (some) types of NFRs are not supported by MDD approaches. Results: Our study shows that practitioners perceive MDD adoption as a complex process with little to no tool support for NFRs, reporting productivity and maintainability as the types of NFRs expected to be supported when MDD is adopted. But in general, companies adapt MDD to deal with NFRs. When NFRs are not supported, the generated code is sometimes changed manually, thus compromising the maintainability of the software developed. However, the interviewed practitioners claim that the benefits of using MDD outweight the extra effort required by these manual adaptations. Conclusion: Overall, the results indicate that it is important for practitioners to handle NFRs in MDD, but further research is necessary in order to lower the barrier for supporting a broad spectrum of NFRs with MDD. Still, much conceptual and tool implementation work seems to be necessary to lower the barrier of integrating the broad spectrum of NFRs in practice."

      "Abstract": "In recent years, machine translation software has increasingly been integrated into our daily lives. People routinely use machine translation for various applications, such as describing symptoms to a foreign doctor and reading political news in a foreign language. However, due to the complexity and intractability of neural machine translation (NMT) models that power modern machine translation systems, these systems are far from being robust. They can return inferior results that lead to misunderstanding, medical misdiagnoses, threats to personal safety, or political conflicts. Despite its apparent importance, validating the robustness of machine translation is very difficult and has, therefore, been much under-explored. \nTo tackle this challenge, we introduce \\textit{structure-invariant testing (SIT)}, a novel metamorphic testing approach for validating machine translation software. Our key insight is that the translation results of “similar” source sentences should typically exhibit a similar sentence structure. Specifically, SIT (1) generates similar source sentences by substituting one word in a given sentence with semantically similar, syntactically equivalent words, and (2) represents sentence structure by syntax parse trees (obtained via constituency or dependency parsing). To evaluate SIT, we have used it to test Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator with 200 source sentences as input, which led to 64 and 70 buggy translations with 69.5% and 70% top-1 accuracy, respectively. The bugs are diverse, including under-translation, over-translation, incorrect modification, word/phrase mistranslation, and unclear logic, none of which could be detected via existing translation quality metrics."

      "Abstract": "Patch recommendation is the process of identifying errors in software systems and suggesting suitable fixes for them. Patch recommendation can significantly improve developer productivity by reducing both the debugging and repairing time. Existing techniques usually rely on complete test suites and detailed debugging reports, which are often absent in practical industrial settings. In this paper, we propose PRECFIX, a pragmatic approach targeting large-scale industrial codebase and making recommendations based on previously observed debugging activities. PRECFIX collects defect-patch pairs from development histories, performs clustering, and extracts generic reusable patching patterns as recommendations. We conducted experimental study on an industrial codebase with 10K projects involving diverse defect patterns. We managed to extract 3K templates of defect-patch pairs, which have been successfully applied to the entire codebase. Our approach is able to make recommendations within milliseconds and achieves a false positive rate of 22% confirmed by manual review. The majority (10/12) of the interviewed developers appreciated PRECFIX, which has been rolled out to Alibaba to support various critical businesses."

      "Abstract": "Crash reproduction approaches help developers during debugging by generating a test case that reproduces a given crash. Several solutions have been proposed to automate this task. However, the proposed solutions have been evaluated on a limited number of projects, making comparison difficult. In this paper, we enhance this line of research by proposing JCrashPack, an extensible benchmark for Java crash reproduction, together with ExRunner, a tool to simply and systematically run evaluations. JCrashPack contains 200 stack traces from various Java projects, including industrial open-source ones. We used JCrashPack to run an extensive evaluation of EvoCrash, the state-of-the-art tool for search-based crash reproduction. EvoCrash successfully reproduced 43% of the crashes. Furthermore, we observed that reproducing NullPointerException, IllegalArgumentException, and IllegalStateException is relatively easier than reproducing ClassCastException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. Our results include a detailed manual analysis of EvoCrash outputs, from which we derive 14 current challenges for crash reproduction, among which the generation of input data and the handling of abstract and anonymous classes are the most frequents. Finally, based on those challenges, we discuss future research directions for search-based crash reproduction for Java."

As Netflix grew, it had the opportunity to explore increasingly specialized improvements to its service, which generated demand for deeper analyses supported by richer metrics and powered by more diverse statistical methodologies. To facilitate this, and more fully harness the skill sets of both engineering and data science, Netflix engineers created a science-centric experimentation platform that leverages the expertise of scientists from a wide range of backgrounds working on data science tasks by allowing them to make direct code contributions in the languages used by them (Python and R). Moreover, the same code that runs in production is able to be run locally, making it straightforward to explore and graduate both metrics and causal inference methodologies directly into production services. \nIn this paper, we provide two main contributions. Firstly, we report on the architecture of this platform, with a special emphasis on its novel aspects: how it supports science-centric end-to-end workflows without compromising engineering requirements. Secondly, we describe its approach to causal inference, which leverages the potential outcomes conceptual framework to provide a unified abstraction layer for arbitrary statistical models and methodologies."

      "Abstract": "CPU cache is limited but crucial storage on modern processor whereas the cache timing side-channel could indirectly leak data through the measurable timing variance. Speculative execution, a reason for the variance and a vital optimization in modern CPUs, can engender severe detriment to deliberate branch mispredictions. Though static analysis can qualitatively verify the timing-leakage-free property under speculative execution, it is incapable of producing endorsements including inputs and speculated flows to diagnose leaks in depth. This work proposes a new approach, Speculative symbolic Execution, for precisely validating cache timing leaks introduced by speculative execution. Generally, given a program with sensitive inputs (leakage-free in non-speculative execution), our method systematically explores the program state space. Meanwhile, it models speculative behavior at conditional branches and accumulates the cache side effects along with subsequent execution. Based on the dynamic exploration and a specified cache model, we construct leak conditions for memory accesses and conduct a constraint-solving based cache behavior analysis to generate leak witnesses. We have implemented our method in a tool named SpecuSym on KLEE, and evaluated it against 14 open-source benchmarks. Experiments show that SpecuSym successfully identified leaks in 6 programs on four different caches and eliminated false positives in 2 programs reported by recent work."

      "Abstract": "Mobile application (app) developers commonly utilize analytic services to analyze their app users’ behavior to support debugging, service quality, and advertising. Anonymization and aggregation can reduce the sensitivity of behavioral data, and analytic services may encourage the use of these protections, however, developers can misconfigure the analytic services and expose personal information to greater privacy risk. Since people use apps in every aspect of their daily lives, apps may contain a lot of personal information, such as a user’s real-time location, health data, or dating preferences. To study this issue and identify potential privacy risks due to such misconfigurations, we developed a semi-automated approach, Privacy-Aware Analytics Misconfiguration Detector (PAMDroid), which enables the empirical analysis of modern analytic service practices. This paper describes a study of 1,000 top apps using top analytic services using PAMDroid in which we found misconfigurations in 120 apps, among which, 52 apps also cause a violation of either the analytic service providers’ terms of service or the app’s own privacy policy."

      "Abstract": "Spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) techniques are widely studied and have been evaluated to be effective in locating faults. Recent studies also showed that developers from industry value automated SBFL techniques. However, their effectiveness is still limited by two main reasons. First, the test coverage information leveraged to construct the spectrum does not reflect the root cause directly. Second, SBFL suffers from the tie issue so that the buggy code entities can not be well differentiated from non-buggy ones. To address these challenges, we propose to leverage the information of version histories in fault localization based on the following two intuitions. First, version histories record how bugs are introduced to software projects and this information reflects the root cause of bugs directly. Second, the evolution histories of code can help differentiate those suspicious code entities ranked in tie by SBFL. Our intuitions are also inspired by the observations on debugging practices from large open source projects and industry. \nBased on the intuitions, we propose a novel technique HSFL (historical spectrum based fault localization). Specifically, HSFL identifies bug-inducing commits from the version history in the first step. It then constructs historical spectrum (denoted as Histrum) based on bug-inducing commits, which is another dimension of spectrum orthogonal to the coverage based spectrum used in SBFL. HSFL finally ranks the suspicious code elements based on our proposed Histrum and the conventional spectrum. HSFL outperforms the state-of-the-art SBFL techniques significantly on the Defects4J benchmark. Specifically, it locates and ranks the buggy statement at Top-1 for $77.8%$ more bugs as compared with SBFL, and $33.9%$ more bugs at Top-5. Besides, for the metrics MAP and MRR, HSFL achieves an average improvement of $28.3%$ and $40.8%$ over all bugs, respectively. Moreover, HSFL can also outperform other six families of fault localization techniques, and our proposed Histrum model can be integrated with different families of techniques and boost their performance."

      "Abstract": "Version Control Systems (VCS) are an important source of information for developers. This calls for a principled understanding of developers’ information seeking in VCS—both for improving existing tools and for understanding requirements for new tools. Our prior work investigated empirically how and why developers seek information in VCS: in this paper, we complement and enrich our prior findings by reanalyzing the data via a theory’s lens. Using the lens of Information Foraging Theory (IFT), we present new insights not revealed by the prior empirical work. \nFirst, while looking for specific information, participants’ foraging behaviors were consistent with other foraging situations in SE; therefore, prior research on IFT-based SE tool design can be leveraged for VCS. Second, in change awareness foraging, participants consumed similar diets, but in subtly different ways than in other situations; this calls for further investigations into change awareness foraging. Third, while committing changes, participants attempted to enable future foragers, but the competing needs of different foraging situations led to tensions that participants failed to balance: this opens up a new avenue for research at the intersection of IFT and SE, namely, creating forageable information. Finally, the results of using an IFT lens on these data provides some evidence as to IFT’s scoping and utility for the version control domain."

      "Abstract": "In integration testing, the existing methods only consider the inter-class direct relationships to evaluate the stubbing cost for class integration test orders, but omit the inter-class indirect relationships caused by control coupling. In this paper, we introduce an integration test order strategy to consider control coupling. We advance the concept of transitive relationship to describe this kind of inter-class relationships and propose a new method to estimate the complexity of test stubs created for a transitive relationship. In this extended abstract we briefly summarize our work."

      "Abstract": "Context: Modern software systems are deployed in sociotechnical settings, combining social entities (humans and organizations) with technical entities (software and devices). In such settings, on top of technical controls that implement security features of software, regulations specify how users should behave in security-critical situations. No matter how carefully the software is designed and how well regulations are enforced, such systems are subject to breaches due to social (user misuse) and technical (vulnerabilities in software) factors. Breach reports, often legally mandated, describe what went wrong during a breach and how the breach was remedied. However, breach reports are not formally investigated in current practice, leading to valuable lessons being lost regarding past failures. \nObjective: Our research aim is to aid security analysts and software developers in obtaining a set of legal, security, and privacy requirements, by developing a crowdsourcing methodology to extract knowledge from regulations and breach reports. \nMethod: We present Corba, a methodology that leverages human intelligence via crowdsourcing, and extracts requirements from textual artifacts in the form of regulatory norms. We evaluate Corba on the US healthcare regulations from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and breach reports published by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Following this methodology, we have conducted a pilot and a final study on the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform. \nResults: Corba yields high quality responses from crowd workers, which we analyze to identify requirements for the purpose of complementing HIPAA regulations. We publish a curated dataset of the worker responses and identified requirements. \nConclusions: The results show that the instructions and question formats presented to the crowd workers significantly affect the response quality regarding the identification of requirements. We have observed significant improvement from the pilot to the final study by revising the instructions and question formats. Other factors, such as worker types, breach types, or length of reports, do not have notable effect on the workers’ performance. Moreover, we discuss other potential improvements such as breach report restructuring and text highlighting with automated methods."

      "Abstract": "Traceability plays an essential role in assuring that software and systems are safe to use. Automated requirements traceability faces the low precision challenge due to a large number of false positives being returned and mingled with the true links. To overcome this challenge, we present a mutation-driven method built on the novel idea of proactively creating many seemingly correct tracing targets (i.e., mutants of a state machine diagram), and then exploiting model checking within process mining to automatically verify whether the safety requirement’s properties hold in the mutants. A mutant is killed if its model checking fails; otherwise, it is survived. We leverage the underlying killed-survived distinction, and develop a correlation analysis procedure to identify the traceability links. Experimental evaluation results on two automotive systems with 27 safety requirements show considerable precision improvements compared with the state-of-the-art."

      "Abstract": "The big data industry is facing new challenges as concerns about privacy leakage soar. One of the remedies to privacy breach incidents is to encapsulate computations over sensitive data within hardware-assisted Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). Such TEE-powered software is called secure enclaves. Security enclaves hold various advantages against competing privacy-preserving computation techniques; however, enclaves are much more challenging to build than ordinary software. The reason is that developing TEE software has to follow a restrictive programming model to make effective use of the strong memory encryption and segregation enforced by hardware. These constraints transitively apply to all third-party dependencies of the software, thus costing developers considerably more engineering efforts. High development and maintenance cost is one of the major obstacles against employing TEE-based privacy protection in production. \nIn this paper, we present our experience and achievements with regard to constructing and continuously maintaining a third-party library supply chain for TEE developers. In particular, we port a large collection of Rust third-party libraries into Intel SGX, one of the most mature trusted computing platforms. Our supply chain accepts upstream patches in a timely manner with SGX-specific security auditing. We have been able to maintain the SGX ports of 159 open-source Rust libraries with reasonable operational costs. Our work can effectively reduce the engineering cost of developing SGX enclaves for privacy-preserving data processing and exchange."

      "Abstract": "Researchers usually discretize a continuous dependent variable into two target classes by introducing an artificial discretization threshold (e.g., median). However, such discretization may introduce noise (i.e., discretization noise) due to ambiguous class loyalty of data points that are close to the artificial threshold. Previous studies do not provide a clear directive on the impact of discretization noise on the classifiers and how to handle such noise. In this paper, we propose a framework to help researchers and practitioners systematically estimate the impact of discretization noise on classifiers in terms of its impact on various performance measures and the interpretation of classifiers. Through a case study of seven software engineering datasets, we find that: 1) discretization noise affects the different performance measures of a classifier differently for different datasets; 2) Though the interpretation of the classifiers are impacted by the discretization noise on the whole, the top 3 most important features are not affected by the discretization noise. Therefore, we suggest that practitioners and researchers use our framework to understand the impact of discretization noise on the performance of their built classifiers and estimate the exact amount of discretization noise to be discarded from the dataset to avoid the negative impact of such noise."

      "Abstract": "Software engineers can find vulnerabilities with less effort if they are directed towards code that might contain more vulnerabilities. HARMLESS is an incremental support vector machine tool that builds a vulnerability prediction model from the source code inspected to date, then suggests what source code files should be inspected next. In this way, HARMLESS can reduce the time and effort required to achieve some desired level of recall for finding vulnerabilities. The tool also provides feedback on when to stop (at that desired level of recall) while at the same time, correcting human errors by double-checking suspicious files. \nThis paper evaluates HARMLESS on Mozilla Firefox vulnerability data. HARMLESS found 80, 90, 95, 99% of the vulnerabilities by inspecting 10, 16, 20, 34% of the source code files. When targeting 90, 95, 99% recall, HARMLESS could stop after inspecting 23, 30, 47% of the source code files. Even when human reviewers fail to identify half of the vulnerabilities (50% false negative rate), HARMLESS could detect 96% of the missing vulnerabilities by double-checking half of the inspected files."

      "Abstract": "As one key resource to learn Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), a lot of API reference documentation lacks code samples with usage scenarios, thus heavily hindering developers from programming with APIs. Although researchers have investigated how to enrich API documentation with code samples from general code search engines, two main challenges remain to be resolved, including the quality challenge of acquiring high-quality code samples and the mapping challenge of matching code samples to usage scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel approach named ADECK towards enriching API documentation with code samples and corresponding usage scenarios by leveraging crowd knowledge from Stack Overflow, a popular technical Question and Answer (Q\u0026amp;A) website attracting millions of developers. Given an API related Q\u0026amp;A pair, a code sample in the answer is extensively evaluated by developers and targeted towards resolving the question under the specified usage scenario. Hence, ADECK can obtain high-quality code samples and map them to corresponding usage scenarios to address the above challenges. Extensive experiments on the Java SE and Android API documentation show that the number of code-sample-illustrated API types in the ADECK-enriched API documentation is 3.35 and 5.76 times as many as that in the raw API documentation. Meanwhile, the quality of code samples obtained by ADECK is better than that of code samples by the baseline approach eXoaDocs in terms of correctness, conciseness, and usability, e.g., the average correctness values of representative code samples obtained by ADECK and eXoaDocs are 4.26 and 3.28 on a 5-point scale in the enriched Java SE API documentation. In addition, an empirical study investigating the impacts of different types of API documentation on the productivity of developers shows that, compared against the raw and the eXoaDocs-enriched API documentation, the ADECK-enriched API documentation can help developers complete 23.81% and 14.29% more programming tasks and reduce the average completion time by 9.43% and 11.03%."

      "Abstract": "Online chatting is gaining popularity and plays an increasingly significant role in software development. When discussing functionalities, developers might reveal their desired features to other developers. Automated mining techniques towards retrieving feature requests from massive chat messages can benefit the requirements gathering process. But it is quite challenging to perform such techniques because detecting feature requests from dialogues requires a thorough understanding of the contextual information, and it is also extremely expensive on annotating feature-request dialogues for learning. To bridge that gap, we recast the traditional text classification task of mapping single dialog to its class into the task of determining whether two dialogues are similar or not by incorporating few-shot learning. We propose a novel approach, named FRMiner, which can detect feature-request dialogues from chat messages via deep Siamese network. We design a BiLSTM-based dialog model that can learn the contextual information of a dialog in both forward and reverse directions. Evaluation on the real-world projects shows that our approach achieves average precision, recall and F1-score of 88.52%, 88.50% and 88.51%, which confirm that our approach could effectively detect hidden feature requests from chat messages, thus can facilitate gathering comprehensive requirements from the crowd in an automated way."

Few games and apps promoting physical activity for people with IDs exist, and they do not have a focus on the motivational aspect. This paper aims to find how to develop software that can motivate people with IDs to do physical activity outdoors. For this purpose, we have followed a design and creation research strategy using several qualitative methods such as semi-structured interviews with health care workers, special education experts and software engineers; a focus group with occupational therapists, physical therapists and software engineers; and a preliminary pilot user test with 3 users and 2 caregivers aiming to a test of the software on the field and at the refinement of its specifications. Having social interaction during the physical activity turned out to be a major motivational aspect of the system, whereas rewards systems did not attract much of the users’ attention. Regarding the adapted navigational assistance, easy-to-read text, visual communication and street-level pictures were the key features to achieve successful and understandable guidance outdoors for people with intellectual disabilities. Since the preliminary experimental pilot was conducted with a small sample size and limited scope that did not let us obtain definitive conclusions about the validity of the prototype, it proved useful to perform a test on the field and to refine the design guidelines in view of a forthcoming large-scale experimental pilot."

      "Abstract": "Diagnosis of memory and resource leaks is regarded as one of the most significant challenges for software developers [1]. Many academic studies, tools, and language features address this challenge and propose techniques for avoidance, diagnosis, and repair of leak-related bugs (with certain emphasis on memory leaks). Evaluation, comparison, and improvement of these techniques can be demanding due to the high effort of reproducing real-world bugs, lack of common benchmarks, and limited knowledge of the characteristics and the distribution of these issues. Thus, a comprehensive data set and empirically grounded understanding of the properties of leak-inducing defects, how the leaks manifest, and how they are repaired can greatly support the progress in this domain. To this end, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study on 491 real-world memory and resource leak defects collected from issue trackers of 15 open-source Java applications. We analyzed a large number of aspects of the collected issues and their repair patches ranging from distribution of leak types to common repair patterns found in patches. Our study significantly complements previous work [2, 3] and expands the research body of empirical studies in terms of detection types, root causes, and repair types of leak-related defects in Java. Our findings and conclusions can be of relevance for designing approaches and tools for diagnosis of leak-related defects, for debugging practices, and for automated repair approaches."

      "Abstract": "Automated grading systems provide feedback to students in a variety of ways, but they typically focus on identifying incorrect program behaviors. Such systems provide notices of test case failures or runtime errors, but without debugging skills, students often become frustrated when they don’t know where to start addressing these defects. Borrowing from work in software engineering research related to automated defect location, we leverage previous research describes using statistical fault localization (SFL) techniques to identify the probable locations of defects in student coding assignments. The goal is to use these SFL techniques to provide a scaffold for students, to direct their debugging efforts without giving too much guidance, and thus minimizing the learning associated with investigating the defects. After determining the “suspiciousness” for each line of code involved in the defect, we create a “heat map” visualization overlay onto their source code of the “suspiciousness” scores to visually guide a student’s attention to parts of their code that are most likely to contain problems. \nThis paper describes the results of an analysis comparing two semesters of our introductory CS1 students, one which had access to the heat map feedback (Fall 2017: n~170), and one that did not (Fall 2015: n~270). The results show that when the heat maps were available, students found it easier to make improvements on their code from submission to submission, as well as spending less time overall achieving the maximum score on the instructor testing assessments. In fact, while we were optimistic in the impact of the heat map feedback, the results we observed were unexpectedly strong. To address this concern, we conducted an additional study, using student submissions from our Spring 2019 CS 1 students (n~230). The results of the second analysis confirmed the results of the first."

      "Abstract": "The assessment of information flows is an essential part of analyzing Android apps, and is frequently supported by static taint analysis. Its precision, however, can suffer from the analysis not being able to precisely determine what elements a pointer can (and cannot) point to. Recent advances in static analysis suggest that incorporating dynamic heap snapshots, taken at one point at runtime, can significantly improve general static analysis. In this paper, we investigate to what extent this also holds for taint analysis, and how various design decisions, such as when and how many snapshots are collected during execution, and how exactly they are used, impact soundness and precision. We have extended FlowDroid to incorporate heap snapshots, yielding our prototype Heapster, and evaluated it on DroidMacroBench, a novel benchmark comprising real-world Android apps that we also make available as an artifact. The results show 1. the use of heap snapshots lowers analysis time while increasing precision; 2. a very good trade-off between precision and recall is achieved by a mixed mode in which the analysis falls back to static points-to relations for objects for which no dynamic data was recorded; and 3. while a single heap snapshot (ideally taken at the end of the execution) suffices to improve performance and precision, a better trade-off can be obtained by using multiple snapshots."

Our results show that developers exhibit poor performance (29% accuracy) when manually assessing whether an assertion oracle contains a false positive, a false negative or none of the two. This shows that automated detection of these oracle deficiencies is beneficial for the users. In our improvement study the developers were able to achieve 21% of full and 43% of partial correctness when improving oracles manually, as opposed to participants who had a support of an automated tool and achieved 33% of full and 67% of partial correctness."

      "Abstract": "The continuous contributions made by long time contributors (LTCs) are a key factor enabling open source software (OSS) projects to be successful and survival. We study GITHUB as it has a large number of OSS projects and millions of contributors, which enables the study of the transition from newcomers to LTCs. In this paper [1], we investigate whether we can effectively predict newcomers in OSS projects to be LTCs based on their activity data that is collected from GITHUB . We collect GITHUB data from GHTorrent, a mirror of GITHUB data. We select the most popular 917 projects, which contain 75,046 contributors. We determine a developer as a LTC of a project if the time interval between his/her first and last commit in the project is larger than a certain time T. In our experiment, we use three different settings on the time interval: 1, 2, and 3 years. There are 9,238, 3,968, and 1,577 contributors who become LTCs of a project in three settings of time interval, respectively. \nTo build a prediction model, we extract many features from the activities of developers on GITHUB , which group into five dimensions: developer profile, repository profile, developer monthly activity, repository monthly activity, and collaboration network. We apply several classifiers including naive Bayes, SVM, decision tree, kNN and random forest. We find that random forest classifier achieves the best performance with AUCs of more than 0.75 in all three settings of time interval for LTCs. We also investigate the most important features that differentiate newcomers who become LTCs from newcomers who stay in the projects for a short time. Finally, we provide several implications for action based on our analysis results to help OSS projects retain newcomers. \nBelow are the main contributions of this paper: \n \n  We build a prediction model based on a total of 63 features from a developer’s first month activities in GITHUB to determine whether a newcomer will become a LTC in a GITHUB project. We conduct an experiment on a total of 75,046 developers from 917 projects. The results show that our approach can effectively predict whether a newcomer will become a LTC soon after he/she submits his/her first commit to the project.  \n  We investigate the most important characteristics that impact a newcomer being a LTC. We find that the number of a contributor’s followers when he/she joins the project is the most important feature in all time interval settings.  \n"

      "Abstract": "Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) grant developers access to functionalities provided by existing code libraries. Due to missing knowledge of how an API is correctly used, developers can unintentionally misuse APIs, and thus introduce bugs. To tackle this issue, recent techniques aim to automatically infer specifications for the correct API usage and to detect misuses. Unfortunately, current techniques suffer from high false-positive rates, leading to many false alarms. While we believe that existing techniques will improve in the future, in this paper, we propose to investigate a different route: We assume that a developer manually detected and fixed an API misuse relating to a third-party library. Based on the change, we can infer a \\emph{correction rule} for the API misuse. Then, we can use this correction rule to detect the same and similar API misuses in the same or other projects. This represents a cooperative technique to transfer the knowledge of API-misuse fixes to other developers. We report initial, promising insights on a technical implementation and empirical evidence on the applicability of our technique based on 43 real-world API misuses."

      "Abstract": "The surprising predictability of source code has triggered a boom in tools using language models for code. Code is much more predictable than natural language, but the reasons are not well understood. We propose a dual channel view of code; code combines a formal channel for specifying execution and a natural language channel in the form of identifiers and comments that assists human comprehension. Computers ignore the natural language channel, but developers read both and, when writing code for longterm use and maintenance, consider each channel’s audience: computer and human. As developers hold both channels in mind, we advance the \\emph{dual channel hypothesis}: the two channels interact and constrain each other. If true, this hypothesis will overturn current, standard practice of considering only the formal channel, or, if both channels, each in isolation. We describe how the constraints of this dual audience setting can lead to humans writing code in a way more predictable than natural language, highlight pioneering research that has implicitly or explicitly used parts of this theory, and drive new research, such as systematically searching for cross-channel inconsistencies. The dual channel hypothesis provides an exciting opportunity as truly multi-disciplinary research; for computer scientists it promises improvements to program analysis via a more holistic approach to code, and to psycholinguists it promises a novel environment for studying linguistic processes."

      "Abstract": "Android apps demand high-quality test inputs, whose generation remains an open challenge. Existing techniques fall short on exploring complex app functionalities reachable only by a long, meaningful, and effective test input. Observing that such test inputs can usually be decomposed into relatively independent short use cases, this paper presents ComboDroid, a fundamentally different Android app testing framework. ComboDroid obtains use cases for manifesting a specific app functionality (either manually provided or automatically extracted), and systematically enumerates the combinations of use cases, yielding high-quality test inputs. \nThe evaluation results of ComboDroid on real-world apps are encouraging. Our fully automatic variant outperformed the best existing technique APE by covering 4.6% more code (APE only outperformed Monkey by 2.1%), and revealed four previously unknown bugs in extensively tested subjects. Our semi-automatic variant boosts the manual use cases obtained with little manual labor, achieving a comparable coverage (only 3.2% less) with a human testing expert."

      "Abstract": "Rust, an emerging programming language with explosive growth, provides a robust type system that enables programmers to write memory-safe and data-race free code. To allow access to a machine’s hardware and to support low-level performance optimizations, a second language, Unsafe Rust, is embedded in Rust. It contains support for operations that are difficult to statically check, such as C-style pointers for access to arbitrary memory locations and mutable global variables. When a program uses these features, the compiler is unable to statically guarantee the safety properties Rust promotes. In this work, we perform a large-scale empirical study to explore how software developers are using Unsafe Rust in real-world Rust libraries and applications. Our results indicate that software engineers use the keyword \\unsafe in less than 30% of Rust libraries, but more than 75% cannot be entirely statically checked by the Rust compiler because of Unsafe Rust hidden somewhere in a library’s call chain. We conclude that although the use of the keyword unsafe is limited, the propagation of unsafeness offers a challenge to the claim of Rust as a memory-safe language. Furthermore, we recommend changes to the Rust compiler and to the central Rust repository’s interface to help Rust software developers be aware of when their Rust code is unsafe."

In this paper, we proposed a deep learning framework to improve the software quality and reliability on these two detect-fix processes. We used advanced code modeling and AI models to have some improvements on the state-of-the-art approaches. The evaluation results shows that our approach can have a relative improvement up to 206% on F-1 score when comparing with baselines on bug detection and can have a relative improvement up to 19.8 times on correct bug-fixing amount when comparing with baselines on automated program repair. These results can prove that our framework can have a outstanding performance on improving software quality and reliability in bug detection and automated program repair processes."

We validate our findings with practitioners. \nResult: We identify two fundamentally different types of required knowledge and explain how different constellations of knowledge gaps in these two respects lead to different session dynamics. Gaps in project-specific systems knowledge are more hampering than gaps in general programming knowledge and are dealt with first and foremost in a PP session. \nConclusion: Partner constellations with complementary knowledge make PP a particularly effective practice. In PP sessions, differences in system understanding are more important than differences in general software development knowledge."

In recent years, testing has been attracting educators’ attention and has been integrated into some Computer Science education programs. To develop and enhance the testing skills of students and novice software testers, insights on how they perceive and perform testing, what challenges do they encounter, and if the novices approach the testing tasks differently than the professionals are demanded but still lacking. \nIn my research, I study how students implement and modify source code given unit tests, and how they perceive and perform unit testing. I propose to quantitatively measure the quality of student-written test code, and qualitatively identify the common mistakes and bad smells observed in student-written test code. We compare the performance of students and professionals, who vary in prior testing experience, to explore the factors that lead to high-quality test code. The ultimate goal of my research is to address the challenges students encountered during test code composition and improve their testing skills with supportive tools or guidance."

      "Abstract": "With the growing use of DevOps tools and frameworks, there is an increased need for tools and techniques that support \\emph{more than code}. The current state-of-the-art in static developer assistance for tools like Docker is limited to shallow syntactic validation. We identify three core challenges in the realm of learning from, understanding, and supporting developers writing DevOps artifacts: (i) nested languages in DevOps artifacts, (ii) rule mining, and (iii) the lack of semantic rule-based analysis. To address these challenges we introduce a toolset, binnacle, that enabled us to ingest 900,000 GitHub repositories. \nFocusing on Docker, we extracted approximately 219,000 Dockerfiles, and also identified a Gold Set of Dockerfiles written by Docker experts. We addressed challenge (i) by reducing the number of effectively uninterpretable nodes in our ASTs by over 80% via a technique we call \\emph{phased parsing}. To address challenge (ii), we introduced a novel rule-mining technique capable of recovering two-thirds of the rules in a benchmark we curated. Through this automated mining, we were able to recover 16 new rules that were not found during manual rule collection. To address challenge (iii), we manually collected a set of rules for Dockerfiles from commits to the files in the Gold Set. These rules encapsulate best practices, avoid docker build failures, and improve image size and build latency. We created an analyzer that used these rules, and found that, on average, Dockerfiles on GitHub violated the rules \\emph{six times more frequently} than the Dockerfiles in our Gold Set. We also found that industrial Dockerfiles fared no better than those sourced from GitHub. \nThe learned rules and analyzer in binnacle can be used to aid developers in the IDE when creating Dockerfiles, and in a post-hoc fashion to identify issues in, and to improve, existing Dockerfiles."

      "Abstract": "Property-based testing is a popular approach for validating the logic of a program. An effective property-based test quickly generates many diverse valid test inputs and runs them through a parameterized test driver. However, when the test driver requires strict validity constraints on the inputs, completely random input generation fails to generate enough valid inputs. Existing approaches to solving this problem rely on whitebox or greybox information collected by instrumenting the input generator and/or test driver. However, collecting such information reduces the speed at which tests can be executed.In this paper, we propose and study a blackbox approach for generating valid test inputs. We first formalize the problem of guiding random input generators towards producing a diverse set of valid inputs. This formalization highlights the role of a \\emph{guide} which governs the space of choices within a random input generator. We then propose a solution based on reinforcement learning (RL), using a tabular, on-policy RL approach to guide the generator. We evaluate this approach, RLCheck, against pure random input generation as well as a state-of-the-art greybox evolutionary algorithm, on four real-world benchmarks. We find that in the same time budget, RLCheck generates an order of magnitude more diverse valid inputs than the baselines."

      "Abstract": "The search space explosion problem is a long-standing challenge for search-based automated program repair (APR). The operation space, which defines how to select appropriate mutation operators, and the ingredient space, which defines how to select appropriate code elements for fixings, are two major factors that determines the search space. Conventional approaches mainly devise fixing strategies via learning from frequent fixing patterns observed on substantial patches collected from either fixing histories or other projects. In this paper, we propose a new direction for search-based APR, that is to repair a bug via learning from how the bug was introduced instead of learning from how other bugs are frequently fixed. Our empirical study reveals that substantial mutation operators and fixing ingredients required to fix a bug can be inferred from the commit that introduced the bug. Based on the findings of our empirical study, we devised a preliminary approach based on bug-inducing commits, which is able to repair 11 new bugs that cannot be repaired by the state-of-the-art techniques. Such results demonstrate that our proposed new idea for searched-based APR is promising."

      "Abstract": "To battle the ever-increasing Android malware, malware family classification, which classifies malware with common features into a malware family, has been proposed as an effective malware analysis method. Several machine-learning based approaches have been proposed for the task of malware family classification. Our study shows that malware families suffer from several data imbalance, with many families with only a small number of malware applications (referred to as few shot malware families in this work). Unfortunately, this issue has been overlooked in existing approaches. Although existing approaches achieve high classification performance at the overall level and for large malware families, our experiments show that they suffer from poor performance and generalizability for few shot malware families, and traditionally downsampling method cannot solve the problem. To address the challenge in few shot malware family classification, we propose a novel siamese-network based learning method, which allows us to train an effective MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) network for embedding malware applications into a real-valued, continuous vector space by contrasting the malware applications from the same or different families. In the embedding space, the performance of malware family classification can be significantly improved for all scales of malware families, especially for few shot malware families, which also leads to the significant performance improvement at the overall level."

      "Abstract": "Software testing is an essential part of the software lifecycle and requires a substantial amount of time and effort. It has been estimated that software developers spend close to 50% of their time on testing the code they write. For these reasons, a long standing goal within the research community is to (partially) automate software testing. While several techniques and tools have been proposed to automatically generate test methods, recent work has criticized the quality and usefulness of the assert statements they generate. Therefore, we employ a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) based approach called ATLAS (AuTomatic Learning of Assert Statements) to automatically generate meaningful assert statements for test methods. Given a test method and a focal method (i.e., the main method under test), ATLAS can predict a meaningful assert statement to assess the correctness of the focal method. We applied ATLAS to thousands of test methods from GitHub projects and it was able to predict the exact assert statement manually written by developers in 31% of the cases when only considering the top-1 predicted assert. When considering the top-5 predicted assert statements, ATLAS is able to predict exact matches in 50% of the cases. These promising results hint to the potential usefulness of our approach as (i) a complement to automatic test case generation techniques, and (ii) a code completion support for developers, who can benefit from the recommended assert statements while writing test code."

      "Abstract": "Priority inflation occurs when a QA engineer or a project manager requesting a feature inflates the priority of their task so that developers deliver the fix or the new functionality faster. We survey developers and show that priority inflation occurs and misallocates developer time. We are the first to apply empirical game-theoretic analysis (EGTA) to a software engineering problem, specifically priority inflation. First, we extract prioritisation strategies from 42,620 issues from Apache’s JIRA, then use TaskAssessor, our EGTA-based modelling approach, to confirm conventional wisdom and show that the common process of a QA engineer assigning priority labels is susceptible to priority inflation. We then show that the common mitigation strategy of having a bug triage team assigning priorities does not resolve priority inflation and slows development. We then use mechanism design to devise assessor-throttling, a new, lightweight prioritisation process, immune to priority inflation. We show that assessor-throttling resolves 97% of high priority tasks, 69% better than simply relying on those filing tasks to assign their priorities. Finally, we present TheFed, a browser extension for Chrome that supports assessor-throttling."

      "Abstract": "The typical hiring pipeline for software engineering occurs over several stages—from phone screening and technical on-site interviews, to offer and negotiation. When these hiring pipelines are “leaky,” otherwise qualified candidates are lost at some stage of the pipeline. These leaky pipelines impact companies in several ways, including hindering a company’s ability to recruit competitive candidates and build diverse software teams. \nTo understand where candidates become disengaged in the hiring pipeline—and what companies can do to prevent it—we conducted a qualitative study on over 10,000 reviews on 19 companies from Glassdoor, a website where candidates can leave reviews about their hiring process experiences. We identified several poor practices which prematurely sabotage the hiring process—for example, not adequately communicating hiring criteria, conducting interviews with inexperienced interviewers, and ghosting candidates. Our findings provide a set of guidelines to help companies improve their hiring pipeline practices—such as being deliberate about phrasing and language during initial contact with the candidate, providing candidates with constructive feedback after their interviews, and bringing salary transparency and long-term career discussions into offers and negotiations. Operationalizing these guidelines helps make the hiring pipeline more transparent, fair, and inclusive."

      "Abstract": "Developers of deep learning applications (shortened as application developers) commonly use deep learning frameworks in their projects. However, due to time pressure, market competition, and cost reduction, developers of deep learning frameworks (shortened as framework developers) often have to sacrifice software quality to satisfy a shorter completion time. This practice leads to technical debt in deep learning frameworks, which results in the increasing burden to both the application developers and the framework developers in future development. \nIn this paper, we analyze the comments indicating technical debt (self-admitted technical debt) in 7 of the most popular open-source deep learning frameworks. Although framework developers are aware of such technical debt, typically the application developers are not. We find that: 1) there is technical debt in all the studied deep learning frameworks. 2) there is design debt, defect debt, documentation debt, test debt, requirement debt, compatibility debt, and algorithm debt in deep learning frameworks. 3) the majority of the technical debt in deep learning framework is design debt (24.07% - 65.27%), followed by requirement debt (7.09% - 31.48%) and algorithm debt (5.62% - 20.67%). In some projects, compatibility debt accounts for more than 10%. These findings illustrate that technical debt is common in deep learning frameworks, and many types of technical debt also impact the deep learning applications. Based on our findings, we highlight future research directions and provide recommendations for practitioners."

      "Abstract": "Continuous Integration (CI) allows software development teams to generate software builds more quickly and periodically (e.g., daily or even hourly). When builds are generated frequently, a long build duration may hold developers from performing other important tasks. Prior research has shown that long build durations may impose a negative overhead to the software development process, since developers may wait for extended periods before engaging in other development activities. However, the reasons behind long build durations are still vague and need an in-depth study. In this paper, we study the characteristics of CI builds that are associated with the long duration of CI builds. Our results reveal that, in addition to the common wisdom factors (e.g., project size, team size, build configuration size, and test density), there are other highly important factors to explain long build durations. Our results help development teams understand the best practices to maintain timely builds."

We identify changes and trends in software project management and we name typical risks inherent to fixed price projects (beyond the common sense that unclear requirements, missing domain knowledge and breakdown of project communication are permanent risks). On this basis, we introduce the notion of a Project Management Office (PMO) and supporting tools and mechanisms which help to identify project risks early. Experience reported is based on eight years of monitoring software development projects with these tools and mechanisms. We also give some insights how PMO at adesso has changed over time and why these changes were implemented. As key message of this paper we show the correlation between the systematic usage of the PMO tools and a decreasing overspend rate over eight years and more than 320 projects."

Fitness functions used by current grey-box fuzzers are not informative in that they cannot distinguish different program executions as long as those executions achieve the same coverage. The problem is that the current fitness functions only consider a union of data, but not the combination of them. As such, fuzzers often get stuck in a local optimum during their search. In this paper, we introduce Ankou, the first grey-box fuzzer that recognizes different \\emph{combinations} of execution information, and present several scalability challenges encountered while designing and implementing Ankou. Our experimental results show that Ankou is $1.94\\times$ and $8.0\\times$ more effective in finding bugs than AFL and Angora, respectively."

      "Abstract": "Software repositories contain a plethora of useful information that can be used to enhance software projects. Prior work has leveraged repository data to improve many aspects of the software development process, such as extracting requirements, identifying potentially defective code, and maintenance and evolution. However, in many cases, project stakeholders are not able to fully benefit from their software repositories due to the fact that they need special expertise to mine those repositories. Also, extracting and linking data from different types of repositories (e.g., source code control and bug repositories) require dedicated effort and time, even if the stakeholder has the expertise to perform such a task. \nMore recently, bots were proposed as means to help automate redundant development tasks and lower the barrier of entry for information extraction. Therefore, in this paper, we use bots to automate and ease the process of extracting useful information from software repositories. While it might seem at first that applying bots on software repositories is the same as using them to answer questions based on Stack Overflow posts, the reality is that there is a big difference between the two. One fundamental difference is the fact that bots that are trained on Stack Overflow data can provide general answers, and will never be able to answer project-specific questions such as \"how many bugs were opened against my project today?\u0027\u0027. Also, we would like to better understand how bots can be applied on software repository data and highlight what is and what is not achievable using bots on top of software repositories. \nTherefore, our goal is to design and build a bot framework for software repositories and perform a case study to examine its efficiency and highlight the challenges facing our framework. The approach contains five main components, a user interaction component, meant to interact with the user; entity recognizer and intent extractor components, meant to process and analyze the user’s natural language input; a knowledge base component, that contains all of the data and information to be queried; and a response generator component, meant to generate a reply message that contains the query’s answer and return it to the user interaction component. To evaluate our framework, we add support for 15 of the most commonly asked questions by software practitioners mentioned in prior work. We then perform a case study with 12 participants using two open-source projects. In particular, we asked those participants to perform a set of tasks using the bot then evaluate it based on its replies. We examine the bot in terms of its effectiveness, efficiency, and accuracy and compare it to a baseline where the survey participants are asked to do the same tasks without using the bot. We also perform a post-survey interview with a subset of the survey participants to better understand the strengths and areas of improvements of the bot approach. \nOur results indicate that bots are useful (as indicated by 90.0% of answers), efficient (as indicated by 84.17% of answers) and accurate (as indicated by 90.8% of tasks) in providing answers to some of the most common questions about software repositories. In comparison to the baseline, the bots significantly outperform the manual process of finding answers to their questions (the survey participants were only able to answer 25.2% of the questions correctly and took much longer to find their answers). Based on our post-survey interviews with the participants, we find that bots can be improved if they enable users to perform deep-dive analysis and help compensate for user errors, e.g., typos. Based on our results, we believe that applying bots on software repositories has the potential to transform the MSR field by significantly lowering the barrier to entry and making the extraction of useful information from software repositories as easy as chatting with a bot. \nIn addition to our findings, the paper provides the following contributions (1) To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use bots on software repositories. Also, our framework allows project stakeholders to extract repository information easily using natural language. (2) We perform an empirical study to evaluate our bot framework and compare it to a baseline. Moreover, we provide insights on areas where bot technology/frameworks still face challenges when applied to software repositories. (3) We make our framework implementation and datasets publicly available in an effort to accelerate future research in the area."

Whilst the number of papers incorporating GL on SE is increasing, there is little empirically known about different aspects of the use of GL in SE research. Method: We used mixed-methods approach for this research. We carried out an Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the use of GL in SE. Then we surveyed the authors of the papers included in the SLR and community experts on the use of GL in SE research. Results: We systematically selected and reviewed 102 SE secondary studies that incorporated GL in SE. We identified two groups based on their reporting: 1) 76 reviews only claim the use of GL; 2) 26 reviews report the results of GL. We also obtained 20 replies from the GL users and 24 replies from the invited experts. Conclusion: There is no common understanding of the meaning of GL in SE. Researchers define the scopes and definition of GL in a variety of ways. We find five main reasons of using GL in SE. The findings have enabled us to propose a conceptual model for the role of GL in SE research lifecycle . There is an important need of research to develop guidelines for using GL in SE and for quality assessment of the literature to be included."

      "Abstract": "Just because software developers say they believe in “X”, that does not necessarily mean that “X” is true. As shown here, there exist numerous beliefs listed in the recent Software Engineering literature which are only supported by small portions of the available data. Hence we ask what is the source of this disconnect between beliefs and evidence?. To answer this question we look for evidence for ten beliefs within 300,000+ changes seen in dozens of open-source projects. Some of those beliefs had strong support across all the projects; specifically, “A commit that involves more added and removed lines is more bug-prone” and “Files with fewer lines contributed by their owners (who contribute most changes) are bug-prone”. Most of the widely-held beliefs studied are only sporadically supported in the data; i.e. large effects can appear in project data and then disappear in subsequent releases. Such sporadic support explains why developers believe things that were relevant to their prior work, but not necessarily their current work. Our conclusion will be that we need to change the nature of the debate with Software Engineering. Specifically, while it is important to report the effects that hold right now, it is also important to report on what effects change over time."

      "Abstract": "With version 9, Java has been given the new module system Jigsaw. Major goals were to simplify the maintainability of the JDK and improve its security by encapsulating modules’ internal types. While the module system successfully limits the visibility of internal types, it does not prevent sensitive data from escaping. Since the module system reasons about types only, objects are allowed to escape even if that module declares the type as internal. Finding such unintended escapes is important, as they may violate a module’s integrity and confidentiality, but is a complex task as it requires one to reason about pointers and type hierarchy. We thus present ModGuard, a novel static analysis based on Doop which complements the Java module system with an analysis to automatically identify instances that escape their declaring module. Along with ModGuard, we contribute a complete formal definition of a module’s entrypoints, i.e., the method implementations that a module actually allows other modules to directly invoke. We further make available a novel micro-benchmark suite MIC9Bench to show the effectiveness but also current shortcomings of ModGuard, and to enable comparative studies in the future. Finally, we describe a case study that we conducted using Apache Tomcat, which shows that a migration of applications towards Jigsaw modules does not prevent sensitive instances from escaping, yet also shows that ModGuard is an effective aid in identifying integrity and confidentiality violations of sensitive instances. The paper has been accepted to IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (IEEE TSE) on July 11th, 2019 and is available as early access since July 29th, 2019."

      "Abstract": "Android testing tools generate sequences of input events to exercise the state space of the app-under-test. Existing search-based techniques systematically evolve a population of event sequences so as to reach certain objectives such as maximal code coverage. The hope is that the mutation of fit event sequences leads to the generation of even fitter event sequences. However, such random mutations may truncate the path of the generated sequence through the app’s state space at the point of the first mutated event. States that contributed considerably to the original sequence’s fitness may not be reached by the sequence’s offspring. \nIn this paper, we propose instead to evolve a population of states which can be captured upon discovery and resumed when needed. The hope is that generating events on a fit program state leads to the transition to even fitter states. For instance, we can quickly deprioritize testing the main screen state which is visited by most event sequences, and instead focus our limited resources on testing more interesting states that are otherwise difficult to reach. \nWe call our approach time-travel testing because of this ability to travel back to any state that has been observed in the past. We implemented time-travel testing into TimeMachine, a time-travel-enabled version of the successful, automated Android testing tool Monkey. In our experiments on a large number of open- and closed-source Android apps, TimeMachine outperforms the state-of-the-art search-based Android testing tools Sapienz and Stoat, both in terms of coverage achieved and crashes found."

It is equally well known, however, that actual capture rarely takes place. A few photos may be taken, informal notes might be scribbled down, and at best one of the developers may be tasked with creating a summary. Regardless, problems persist with important information being lost and, even when information is captured, that information not being easily located and accessed. To address these problems, I propose to design and evaluate a novel suite of tools that enables software designers working at the whiteboard to: (1) efficiently and in-the-moment capture important information produced during that meeting, and (2) be delivered, either by request or proactively by the tools, relevant information captured in the past when it is needed in a future design meeting."

      "Abstract": "Can automated adaptive feedback for correcting erroneous programs help novice programmers learn to code better? In a large-scale experiment, we compare student performance when tutored by human tutors, and when receiving automated adaptive feedback. The automated feedback was designed using one of two well-known instructional principles: (i) presenting the correct solution for the immediate problem, or (ii) presenting generated examples or analogies that guide towards the correct solution. We report empirical results from a large-scale (10,000+ person hour) experiment assessing the efficacy of these automated compilation-error feedback tools. Using the survival analysis on error rates of students measured over seven weeks, we found that automated feedback allows students to resolve errors in their code more efficiently than students receiving manual feedback. However, we also found that this advantage is primarily logistical and not conceptual; the performance benefit seen during lab assignments disappeared during exams wherein feedback of any kind was withdrawn. We further found that the performance advantage of automated feedback over human tutors increases with problem complexity, and that feedback via example and specific repair have distinct, non-overlapping relative advantages for different categories of programming errors. Our results offer a clear and granular delimitation of the pedagogical benefits of automated feedback in teaching programming to novices."

      "Abstract": "Static analysis is a proven technique for ensuring software quality automatically catching bugs early during development. However, analysis tooling must approximate, both theoretically and in the interest of practicality. False positives are a pervading manifestation of such approximations–tool configuration and customization is therefore crucial for usability and directing analysis behavior. To suppress false positives, developers readily disable bug checks or insert comments that suppress spurious bug reports. Existing work shows that these mechanisms fall short of developer needs and present a significant pain point for using or adopting analyses. We draw on the insight that an analysis user always has one notable ability to influence analysis behavior regardless of analysis options and implementation: modifying their program. Indeed, developers find that they can effectively suppress false positives by changing their code slightly; this exercise is however manual, ad-hoc, and can introduce awkward or redundant code. We present a new technique for automated, generic, and temporary code changes that tailor to suppress spurious analysis errors. We adopt a rule-based approach where simple, declarative templates describe general syntactic changes for code patterns that are known to be problematic for the analyzer. Our technique promotes program transformation as a general primitive for improving the fidelity of analysis reports (we treat any given analyzer as a black box). Our evaluation is the first systematic study to broadly demonstrate the applicability and benefits of this technique and perspective: we evaluate using five different static analyzers supporting three different languages (C, Java, and PHP) on large, real world programs (\u0026gt;800KLOC). We show that our approach is effective in sidestepping long-standing and complex issues in analysis implementations."

      "Abstract": "UML modeling is an important skill to learn and exercise in software engineering. However, modeling is often not tangible for students and is often not appreciated by beginners. Students prefer coding because they receive immediate feedback from the compiler which is not the case for modeling. Engaging students in modeling is difficult, especially in large introductory courses. \nWe have developed an interactive learning method for modeling which is based on an easy to use online editor. Students get to know modeling in guided tutorials during in-class exercises right after the theory was introduced and deepen their modeling skills in group work and homework exercises subsequently. This learning method was applied in a very large software engineering introductory course with more than 1000 students which emphasizes the benefits of modeling in all phases of software development. \nAn empirical evaluation of the method demonstrated that the students’ learning outcome in modeling improved significantly by up to 87 %. Students are motivated to use models in their future software engineering projects and understand how to approach problems with models. The use of interactive models in programming exercises improves their understanding of the taught concepts."

However, although local technology meetups are well-attended by developers, little is known about their motivations for participating, the type or usefulness of information that they acquire, and how local meetups might differ from and complement other available information channels for software engineering information. We interviewed the leaders of technology-oriented Meetup groups, and collected quantitative information via a survey distributed to participants in technology-oriented groups. Our findings suggest that participants in these groups are primarily experienced software practitioners, who use Meetup for staying abreast of new developments, building local networks and exchanging tacit knowledge with peers to improve their practice. We suggest that face to face meetings are useful forums for exchanging tacit knowledge and contextual information needed for software engineering practice."

While researchers have found that cognitive biases occur in development tasks in controlled lab studies, we still don’t know how these biases affect developers’ everyday behavior. Without such an understanding, development tools and practices remain inadequate. To close this gap, we conducted a 2-part field study to examine the extent to which cognitive biases occur, the consequences of these biases on developer behavior, and the practices and tools that developers’ use to deal with these biases. About 70% of observed actions that were reversed were associated with at least one cognitive bias. Further, even though developers recognized that biases frequently occur, they routinely are forced to deal with such issues with ad hoc processes, and sub-optimal tool support. As one participant (IP12) lamented: There is no salvation!"

      "Abstract": "Open source software systems have gained a lot of attention in the past few years. With the emergence of open source platforms like GitHub, developers can contribute, store, and manage their projects with ease. Large organizations like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook are open sourcing their in-house technologies in an effort to more broadly involve the community in the development of software systems. Although closed source and open source systems have been studied extensively, there has been little research on the transition from closed source to open source systems. Through this study we aim to: a) provide guidance and insights for other teams planning to open source their projects and b) to help them avoid pitfalls during the transition process. We studied six different Microsoft systems, which were recently open-sourced i.e., CoreFX, CoreCLR, Roslyn, Entity Framework, MVC, and Orleans. This paper presents the transition from the viewpoints of both Microsoft and the open source community based on interviews with eleven Microsoft developer, five Microsoft senior managers involved in the decision to open source, and eleven open-source developers. From Microsoft’s perspective we discuss the reasons for the transition, experiences of developers involved, and the transition’s outcomes and challenges. Our results show that building a vibrant community, prompt answers, developing an open source culture, security regulations and business opportunities are the factors which persuade companies to open source their products. We also discuss the transition outcomes on processes such as code reviews, version control systems, continuous integration as well as developers’ perception of these changes. From the open source community’s perspective, we illustrate the response to the open-sourcing initiative through contributions and interactions with the internal developers and provide guidelines for other projects planning to go open source."

      "Abstract": "The number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has reached 7 billion globally in early 2018 and are nearly ubiquitous in daily life. IoT devices usually implement communication protocols such as USB and Bluetooth within firmware to allow a wide range of functionality. Thus analyzing firmware using domain knowledge from these protocols is vital to understand device behavior, detect implementation bugs, and identify malicious components. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of these protocols, there is usually no formal specification available that can help automate the firmware analysis; as a result, significant manual effort is currently required to study these protocols and to reverse engineer the device firmware. In this paper, we propose a new firmware analysis methodology using symbolic execution called ProXray, which can learn a protocol model from known firmware, and apply the model to recognize the protocol relevant fields and detect functionality within unknown firmware automatically. After the training phase, ProXray can fully automate the firmware analysis process while supporting user’s queries in the form of protocol relevant constraints. We have applied ProXray to the USB and the Bluetooth protocols by learning protocol constraint models from firmware that implement these protocols. We are then able to map protocol fields and identify USB functionality automatically while achieving more than an order of magnitude speedup in reaching the Bluetooth protocol relevant targets in our testing set of unknown firmware. Our model achieved high coverage of the USB and Bluetooth specifications for several important protocol fields. ProXray provides a new method to apply domain knowledge to firmware analysis automatically."

On one hand, moderation is of crucial importance in maintaining the content quality indispensable for the future sustainability of the site. On the other hand, details about the closing reason might frequently appear blurred to the user, which leads to debates and occasional negative behavior in answers or comments. With the aim of helping the users compose good quality questions, we introduce a set of classifiers for the categorization of Stack Overflow posts prior to their actual submission. Our binary classifier is capable of predicting whether a question will be closed after posting with an accuracy of 71.87%. Additionally, in this study we propose the first multiclass classifier to estimate the exact reason of closing a question to an accuracy of 48.55%. Both classifiers are based on Gated Recurrent Units and trained solely on the pre-submission textual information of Stack Overflow posts."

      "Abstract": "Data modeling in Cassandra databases follows a query-driven approach where each table is created to satisfy a query, leading to repeated data as the Cassandra model is not normalized by design. Consequently, developers bear the responsibility to maintain the data integrity at the application level, as opposed to when the model is normalized. This is done by embedding in the client application the appropriate statements to perform data changes, which is error prone. Cassandra data modeling methodologies have emerged to cope with this problem by proposing the use of a conceptual model to generate the logical model, solving the data modeling problem but not the data integrity one. In this thesis we address the problem of the integrity of these data by proposing a method that, given a data change at either the conceptual or the logical level, determines the executable statements that should be issued to preserve the data integrity. Additionally, as this integrity may also be lost as a consequence of creating new data structures in the logical model, we complement our method to preserve data integrity in these scenarios. Furthermore, we address the creation of data structures at the conceptual level to represent a normalized version of newly created data structures in the logical model."

      "Abstract": "Recently we have worked with a dozen industrial collaborators to pinpoint and quantify architecture debts, from multi-national corporations to startup companies. Our technology leverages a wide range of project data, from source file dependency to issue records, and we interacted with projects of various sizes and characteristics. \nCrossing the border between research and practice, we have observed significant gaps in terms of data availability and quality among projects of different kinds. Compared with successful open source projects, data from proprietary projects are rarely complete or well-organized. Consequently, not all projects can benefit from all the features we provide, which, in turn, made them aware of the need to improve their development processes. \nIn this paper, we categorize the commonly observed differences between open source and proprietary project data, analyze the reasons for such differences, and propose suggestions to minimize the gap, to facilitate advances to both software research and practice."

      "Abstract": "Context: Multiple types of processing units (e.g., CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs) can be used jointly to achieve better performance in computational systems. However, these units are built with fundamentally different characteristics and demand attention especially towards software deployment. Objective: The goal of this work is to summarize the state-of-the-art of software deployment on heterogeneous platforms. We provide an overview of the research area by searching for and categorizing relevant studies, as well as discussing gaps and trends of the field. We are interested in the main concerns (RQ1) and the approaches used (RQ2) when deploying software on heterogeneous platforms. Method: In order to achieve our goal, we performed a systematic mapping study, which refers to a method for reviewing literature with basis on predefined search strategies and a multi-step selection process. Results: We selected and analyzed 146 primary studies from multiple sources and found that the area of research is dominated by solution proposals. The majority of the studies discuss concerns about scheduling, the quality of the software, and its architecture. A large number of studies focuses on the problem of scheduling tasks and processes. We found approaches that are applied at different binding times (i.e., design time, runtime, orthogonal). Conclusion: The evaluation of the proposed solutions in an industrial context is missing. Also, the proposed methods have not been evaluated in development processes. Most of the methods address a particular concern, or a few concerns, while there is a lack of a holistic approach."

      "Abstract": "During code review, developers critically examine each others’ code to improve its quality, share knowledge, and ensure conformance to coding standards. In the process, developers may have negative interpersonal interactions with their peers, which can lead to frustration and stress; these negative interactions may ultimately result in developers abandoning projects. In this mixed-methods study at one company, we surveyed 1,317 developers to characterize the negative experiences and cross-referenced the results with objective data from code review logs to predict these experiences. Our results suggest that such negative experiences, which we call “pushback”, are relatively rare in practice, but have negative repercussions when they occur. Our metrics can predict feelings of pushback with high recall but low precision, making them potentially appropriate for highlighting interactions that may benefit from a self-intervention."

      "Abstract": "Stack Overflow accumulates an enormous amount of software engineering knowledge. However, as time passes, certain knowledge in answers may become obsolete. Such obsolete answers, if not identified or documented clearly, may mislead answer seekers and cause unexpected problems (e.g., using an out-dated security protocol). In this paper, we investigate how the knowledge in answers becomes obsolete and identify the characteristics of such obsolete answers. We find that: 1) More than half of the obsolete answers (58.4%) were probably already obsolete when they were first posted. 2) When an obsolete answer is observed, only a small proportion (20.5%) of such answers are ever updated. 3) Answers to questions in certain tags (e.g., node.js, ajax, android, and objective-c) are more likely to become obsolete. Our findings suggest that Stack Overflow should develop mechanisms to encourage the whole community to maintain answers (to avoid obsolete answers) and answer seekers are encouraged to carefully go through all information (e.g., comments) in answer threads."

Municipalities recently began collecting large amounts of water-related data and considering the adoption of deep learning solutions like recurrent neural network (RNN) for overflow prediction. In this paper, we develop a novel metamorphic relation to characterize RNN robustness in the presence of missing data. We show how this relation drives automated testing of three implementation variants: LSTM, GRU, and IndRNN thereby uncovering deficiencies and suggesting more robust solutions for overflow prediction."

For historical and technical reasons, frequentist statistics have long been the most widely used, and remain the standard choice in empirical software engineering. In recent years, however, Bayesian statistics have slowly become more prominent while, at the same time, statistical practices commonly associated with frequentist statistics have been criticized because of technical and methodological shortcomings. This paper argues that Bayesian techniques can bring benefits to software engineering data analysis, and they can help raise the quality and impact of empirical research in this area."

      "Abstract": "Online mini games are lightweight game apps, typically implemented in JavaScript (JS), that run inside another host mobile app (such as WeChat, Baidu, and Alipay). These mini games do not need to be downloaded or upgraded through an app store, making it possible for one host mobile app to perform the aggregated services of many apps. Hundreds of millions of users play tens of thousands of mini games, which make a great profit, and consequently are popular targets of plagiarism. In cases of plagiarism, deeply obfuscated code cloned from the original code often embodies malicious code segments and copyright infringements, posing great challenges for existing plagiarism detection tools. To address these challenges, in this paper, we design and implement JSidentify, a hybrid framework to detect plagiarism among online mini games. JSidentify includes three techniques based on different levels of code abstraction. JSidentify applies the included techniques in the constructed priority list one by one to reduce overall detection time. Our evaluation results show that JSidentify outperforms other existing related state-of-the-art approaches and achieves the best precision and recall with affordable detection time when detecting plagiarism among online mini games and clones among general JS programs. Our deployment experience of JSidentify also shows that JSidentify is indispensable in the daily operations of online mini games in WeChat."

      "Abstract": "Performance is an important aspect of software quality. The goals of performance are typically defined by setting upper and lower bounds for response time of a system and physical level measurements such as CPU, memory and I/O. To meet such performance goals, several performance-related activities are needed in development (Dev) and operations (Ops). In fact, large software system failures are often due to performance issues rather than functional bugs. One of the most important performance issues is performance regression. Although performance regressions are not all bugs, they often have a direct impact on users’ experience of the system. The process of detection of performance regressions in development and operations is faced with a lot of challenges. First, the detection of performance regression is conducted after the fact, i.e., after the system is built and deployed in the field or dedicated performance testing environments. Large amounts of resources are required to detect, locate, understand and fix performance regressions at such a late stage in the development cycle. Second, even we can detect a performance regression, it is extremely hard to fix it because other changes are applied to the system after the introduction of the regression. These challenges call for further in-depth analyses of the performance regression. In this dissertation, to avoid performance regression slipping into operation, we first perform an exploratory study on the source code changes that introduce performance regressions in order to understand root-causes of performance regression in the source code level. Second, we propose an approach that automatically predicts whether a test would manifest performance regressions in a code commit. To assist practitioners to analyze system performance with operational data, we propose an approach to recovering filed-representative workload that can be used to detect performance regression. We also propose that using execution logs generated by unit tests to predict performance regression in load tests."

      "Abstract": "Empirical studies have shown that mobile applications that do not drain battery usually get good ratings from users. To make mobile application energy efficient many studies have been published that present refactoring guidelines and tools to optimize the code. However, these guidelines cannot be generalized w.r.t energy efficiency, as there is not enough energy-related data for every context. Existing energy enhancement tools/profilers are mostly prototypes applicable to only a small subset of energy-related problems. In addition, the existing guidelines and tools mostly address the energy issues once they have already been introduced. My goal is to add to the existing energy-related data by evaluating the energy consumption of various code smell refactorings and third-party libraries used in Android development. Data from such evaluations could provide generalized contextual guidelines that could be used during application development to prevent the introduction of energy-related problems. I also aim to develop a support tool for the Android Studio IDE that could give meaningful recommendations to developers during development to make the application code more energy efficient."

      "Abstract": "Distributed systems pose unique challenges for software developers. Understanding the system’s communication topology and reasoning about concurrent activities of system hosts can be difficult. The standard approach, analyzing system logs, can be a tedious and complex process that involves reconstructing a system log from multiple hosts’ logs, reconciling timestamps among hosts with non-synchronized clocks, and understanding what took place during the execution encoded by the log. This paper presents a novel approach for tackling three tasks frequently performed during analysis of distributed system executions: (1) understanding the relative ordering of events, (2) searching for specific patterns of interaction between hosts, and (3) identifying structural similarities and differences between pairs of executions. Our approach consists of XVector, which instruments distributed systems to capture partial ordering information that encodes the happens-before relation between events, and ShiViz, which processes the resulting logs and presents distributed system executions as interactive time-space diagrams. Two user studies with a total of 109 students and a case study with 2 developers showed that our method was effective, helping participants answer statistically significantly more system-comprehension questions correctly, with a very large effect size."

      "Abstract": "Just-in-Time (JIT) defect prediction—a technique which aims to predict bugs at change level—has been paid more attention. JIT defect prediction leverages the SZZ approach to identify bug-introducing changes. Recently, researchers found that the performance of SZZ (including its variants) is impacted by a large amount of noise. SZZ may considerably mislabel changes that are used to train a JIT defect prediction model, and thus impact the prediction accuracy. \nIn this paper, we investigate the impact of the mislabeled changes by different SZZ variants on the performance and interpretation of JIT defect prediction models. We analyze four SZZ variants (i.e., B-SZZ, AG-SZZ, MA-SZZ, and RA-SZZ) that are proposed by prior studies. We build the prediction models using the labeled data by these four SZZ variants. Among the four SZZ variants, RA-SZZ is least likely to generate mislabeled changes, and we construct the testing set by using RA-SZZ. All of the four prediction models are then evaluated on the same testing set. We choose the prediction model built on the labeled data by RA-SZZ as the baseline model, and we compare the performance and metric importance of the models trained using the labeled data by the other three SZZ variants with the baseline model. Through a large-scale empirical study on a total of 126,526 changes from ten Apache open source projects, we find that in terms of various performance measures (AUC, F1-score, G-mean and Recall@20%), the mislabeled changes by B-SZZ and MA-SZZ are not likely to cause a considerable performance reduction, while the mislabeled changes by AG-SZZ cause a statistically significant performance reduction with an average difference of 1%–5%. When considering developers’ inspection effort (measured by LOC) in practice, the mislabeled changes by B-SZZ and AG-SZZ lead to 9%–10% and 1%–15% more wasted inspection effort, respectively. And the mislabeled changes by B-SZZ lead to significantly more wasted effort. The mislabeled changes by MA-SZZ do not cause considerably more wasted effort. We also find that the top-most important metric for identifying bug-introducing changes (i.e., number of files modified in a change) is robust to the mislabeling noise generated by SZZ. But the second- and third-most important metrics are more likely to be impacted by the mislabeling noise, unless random forest is used as the underlying classifier."

      "Abstract": "Software developers in big and medium-size companies are working with millions of lines of code in their codebases. Assuring the quality of this code has shifted from simple defect management to proactive assurance of internal code quality. Although static code analysis and code reviews have been at the forefront of research and practice in this area, code reviews are still an effort-intensive and interpretation-prone activity. The aim of this research is to support code reviews by automatically recognizing company-specific code guidelines violations in large-scale, industrial source code. In our action research project, we constructed a machine-learning-based tool for code analysis where software developers and architects in big and medium-sized companies can use a few examples of source code lines violating code/design guidelines (up to 700 lines of code) to train decision-tree classifiers to find similar violations in their codebases (up to 3 million lines of code)."

      "Abstract": "Mobile banking apps, belonging to the most security-critical app category, render massive and dynamic transactions susceptible to security risks. Given huge financial losses caused by vulnerabilities, existing research lacks a comprehensive empirical study on the security risks of global banking apps to provide useful insights and improve the security of banking apps. \nSince data-related weaknesses in banking apps are critical and may directly cause serious financial loss, this paper first revisits the state-of-the-art available tools and finds that they have limited capability in identifying data-related weaknesses of banking apps. To complement the capability of existing tools in data-related weakness detection, we propose a three-phase automated security risk assessment system, named Ausera, which leverages static program analysis techniques and sensitive keyword identification. By leveraging Ausera, we collect 2,157 weaknesses in 693 real-world banking apps across 83 countries, which we use as a basis to conduct a comprehensive empirical study from different aspects, such as global distribution and weakness evolution during version updates. We find that apps owned by subsidiary banks are always less secure than or equivalent to those owned by parent banks. In addition, we also track the weakness fixing and receive much useful feedback from banking entities so as to improve the security of banking apps in practice. We further find that weaknesses derived from outdated versions of banking apps or third-party libraries are highly prone to being exploited by attackers. To date, we highlight that 21 banks have confirmed the weaknesses we reported (including 126 weaknesses in total). We also exchange insights with 7 banks, such as HSBC in UK and OCBC in Singapore, via in-person or online meetings to help them improve their apps. We hope that the insights developed in this paper will inform the communities about the gaps among multiple stakeholders, including banks, academic researchers, and third-party security companies."

      "Abstract": "When computations consist of different processes or threads that may execute at the same time or in an interleaved manner, we say the computation is concurrent or that it exhibits concurrency. University students often struggle to reason about concurrency. Researchers have presented students with natural language descriptions of scenarios involving concurrency and have evaluated students’ natural language responses to explore their prior knowledge and to determine characteristics of student reasoning about concurrency. However, natural language responses are necessarily abstract and pertain to the design stage, while studies in which students are asked to implement solutions provide a more concrete view of student reasoning and reveal difficulties that arise when putting design into practice. What is the nature of university students’ conceptions of concurrency? In this work we build upon prior work and ask: What are common and problematic features in student approaches to solving concurrency-related problems? How are these features represented across the phases of the software development process (requirements - design/specification - implementation- quality assurance)? In this study we asked students enrolled in a jointly offered upper division undergraduate / MS level course on “Programming with Concurrency” to implement a solution to the same problem (a sidekick/superhero version of the party matching problem) using two different approaches: threads-based in Java, and actors-based in Scala. We performed qualitative feature analysis of their implementations and their journal reflections to better understand student reasoning when programming concurrent solutions. The feature of additional complexity found in our design study was also represented in student implementations and adversely impacted student success as their programs became cumbersome and hard to trace. Student reflections provided insight into their resistance to modeling prior to implementation, and they found formal modeling techniques difficult. These findings suggest that lighter weight interventions that address student difficulties earlier in the development process may be more palatable to students and thus have substantial impact."

RNNs depend on word embeddings that are usually pre-trained by third parties to encode textual inputs to numerical values. It is well known that problematic word embeddings can lead to low model accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new technique to automatically diag- nose how problematic embeddings impact model performance, by comparing model execution traces from correctly and incorrectly executed samples. We then leverage the diagnosis results as guid- ance to harden/repair the embeddings. Our experiments show that TRADER can consistently and effectively improve accuracy for real world models and datasets by 5.37% on average, which represents substantial improvement in the literature of RNN models."

      "Abstract": "Test-based automated program repair has been a prolific field of research in software engineering in the last decade. Many approaches have indeed been proposed, which leverage test suites as a weak, but affordable, approximation to program specifications. While the literature regularly sets new records on the number of benchmark bugs that can be fixed, several studies increasingly raise concerns about the limitations and biases of state-of-the-art approaches. For example, the correctness of generated patches has been questioned in a number of studies, while other researchers pointed out that evaluation schemes may be misleading with respect to the processing of fault localization results. Nevertheless, there is little work addressing the efficiency of patch generation, with regard to the practicality of program repair. In this paper, we fill this gap in the literature, by providing an extensive review on the efficiency of test suite based program repair. We focus on assessing the number of generated patch candidates, since this information is correlated to (1) the strategy to traverse the search space efficiently in order to select sensical repair attempts, (2) the strategy to minimize the test effort for identifying a plausible patch, (3) as well as the strategy to prioritize the generation of a correct patch. To that end, we perform a large-scale empirical study on the efficiency, in terms of quantity of generated patch candidates of the 16 open-source repair tools for Java programs. The experiments are carefully run under the same fault localization configurations to limit biases. Eventually, among other findings, we note that: (1) many irrelevant patch candidates are generated by APR tools by changing wrong code locations; (2) however, if the search space is carefully triaged, fault localization noise has little impact on patch generation efficiency; (3) yet, current template-based repair systems, which are known to be most effective in fixing a large number of bugs, are actually least efficient as they tend to generate majoritarily irrelevant patch candidates."

      "Abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) systems are key enablers for engineering intelligent applications due to their ability to solve complex tasks such as image recognition and machine translation. Nevertheless, using DL systems in safety- and security-critical applications requires to provide testing evidence for their dependable operation. Recent research in this direction focuses on adapting testing criteria from traditional software engineering as a means of increasing confidence for their correct behaviour. However, they are inadequate in capturing the intrinsic properties exhibited by these systems. We bridge this gap by introducing DeepImportance, a systematic testing methodology accompanied by an Importance-Driven (IDC) test adequacy criterion for DL systems. Applying IDC enables to establish a layer-wise functional understanding of the importance of DL system components and use this information to guide the generation of semantically-diverse test sets. Our empirical evaluation on several DL systems, across multiple DL datasets and with state-of-the-art adversarial generation techniques demonstrates the usefulness and effectiveness of DeepImportance and its ability to guide the engineering of more robust DL systems."

      "Abstract": "As software practitioners, we can help society by using our communities of experts to address a software need of a socially-conscious organization. Doing so can benefit society in the locale of a software engineering conference, and provides access to international experts for local organizations which may otherwise not have access. In addition, we as conference participants not only get to visit the conference location, but also get to know more about it, the issues its denizens face. In addition, we get a small chance to contribute to solving these issues and give back to the community hosting the conference. Both established Software Engineering (SE) researchers as well as practitioners and students have the opportunity for a unique learning experience. In this paper, we argue that the SE community should use SE conferences as the focal points for activities that benefit society at the locations of the conferences, and make such activities an integral, valued, and recognized part of the conference programs. The proposed series of events, termed SE Cares, can follow and learn from the model of Requirements Engineering (RE) Cares events that took place in 2018 and 2019, and be a co-located event at all interested SE-related conferences. In this paper, we share our experience preparing and running RE Cares events, discuss and generalize to the SE community our lessons learned, and advocate for the establishment of an SE Cares organization that assists with the planning, execution, and follow-up of global SE Cares events."

      "Abstract": "Modern software systems usually contain enormous code comments which provide abundant information that have been leveraged to help perform various software engineering tasks, such as bug detection, specification inference, and code synthesis. However, existing work barely leverages program analysis to systematically derive, refine, and propagate comments. For example, by propagation via program analysis, comments can be passed on to code entities that are not commented such that code bugs can be detected leveraging the propagated comments. Developers usually comment on different aspects of code elements like methods, and use comments to describe various contents, such as functionalities and properties. To more effectively utilize comments, a fined-grained and elaborated taxonomy of comments and a reliable classifier to automatically categorize a comment are needed. In this paper, we build a comprehensive taxonomy and propose using program analysis to propagate comments. We develop a prototype CPC, and evaluate it on 5 projects. The evaluation results demonstrate 41573 new comments can be derived by propagation from other code locations with 88% accuracy. Among them, we can derive precise functional comments for 87 native methods that have neither existing comments nor source code. Leveraging the propagated comments, we detect 37 new bugs in open source large projects, 30 of which have been confirmed and fixed by developers, and 304 defects in existing comments (by looking at inconsistencies between existing and propagated comments), including 12 incomplete comments and 292 wrong comments. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. Our user study confirms propagated comments align well with existing comments in terms of quality."

Despite the additional effort required to perform those practices, current cost models either do not consider security as an input or were not properly validated with empirical data. Hypothesis: increasing degrees of application of security practices and security features, motivated by security risks, lead to growing levels of added software development effort. Such an effort increase can be quantified through a parametric model that takes as input the usage degrees of security practices and requirements and outputs the additional software development effort. Contributions: the accurate prediction of secure software development effort will support the provision of a proper amount of resources to projects. We also expect that the quantification of the security effort will contribute to advance research on the cost-effectiveness of software security."

      "Abstract": "Code reviewing is a commonly used practice in software development. It refers to the process of reviewing new code changes before they are merged with the code base. However, to perform the review, developers are mostly assigned manually to code changes. This may lead to problems such as: a time-consuming selection process, limited pool of known candidates and risk of over-allocation of a few reviewers. To address the above problems, we developed Carrot, a machine learning-based tool to recommend code reviewers. We conducted an improvement case study at Ericsson. We evaluated Carrot using a mixed approach. we evaluated the prediction accuracy using historical data and the metrical Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Furthermore, we deployed the tool in one Ericsson project and evaluated how adequate the recommendations were from the point of view of the tool users and the recommended reviewers. We also asked the opinion of senior developers about the usefulness of the tool. The results show that Carrot can help identify relevant non-obvious reviewers and be of great assistance to new developers. However, there were mixed opinions on Carrot’s ability to assist with workload balancing and the decrease code review lead time."

      "Abstract": "Software localization is the process of adapting a software product to the linguistic, cultural and technical requirements of a target market. It allows software companies to access foreign markets that would be otherwise difficult to penetrate. Many studies have been carried out to locate need-to-translate strings in software and adapt UI layout after text translation in the new language. However, no work has been done on the most important and time-consuming step of software localization process, i.e., the translation of software text. Due to some unique characteristics of software text, for example, application-specific meanings, context-sensitive translation, domain-specific rare words, general machine translation tools such as Google Translate cannot properly address linguistic and technical nuance in translating software text for software localization. In this paper, we propose a neural-network based translation model specifically designed and trained for mobile application text translation. We collect large-scale human-translated bilingual sentence pairs inside different Android applications, which are crawled from Google Play store. We customize the original RNN encoder-decoder neural machine translation model by adding categorical information addressing the domain-specific rare word problem which is common phenomenon in software text. We evaluate our approach in translating the text of testing Android applications by both BLEU score and exact match rate. The results show that our method outperforms the general machine translation tool, Google Translate, and generates more acceptable translation for software localization with less needs for human revision. Our approach is language independent, and we show the generality of our approach between English and the other five official languages used in United Nation (UN)."

      "Abstract": "In practice, a popular and coarse-grained approach for recovering from a problematic commit is to revert it (i.e., undoing the change). However, reverted commits could induce some issues for software development, such as impeding the development progress and increasing the difficulty for maintenance. In order to mitigate these issues, we set out to explore the following central question: can we characterize and identify which commits will be reverted? In this paper, we characterize commits using 27 commit features and build an identification model to identify commits that will be reverted. We first identify reverted commits by analyzing commit messages and comparing the changed content, and extract 27 commit features that can be divided into three dimensions, namely change, developer and message, respectively. Then, we build an identification model (e.g., random forest) based on the extracted features. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we perform an empirical study on ten open source projects including a total of 125,241 commits. Our experimental results show that our model outperforms two baselines in terms of AUC-ROC and cost-effectiveness (i.e., percentage of detected reverted commits when inspecting 20% of total changed LOC). In terms of the average performance across the ten studied projects, our model achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.756 and a cost-effectiveness of 0.746, significantly improving the baselines by substantial margins. In addition, we found that “developer” is the most discriminative dimension among the three dimensions of features for the identification of reverted commits. However, using all the three dimensions of commit features leads to better performance."

      "Abstract": "Smart contracts are Turing-complete programs that execute on the infrastructure of the blockchain, which often manage valuable digital assets. Solidity is one of the most popular programming languages for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.Like traditional programs, smart contracts may contain vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional programs, smart contracts cannot be easily patched once they are deployed. It is thus important that smart contracts are tested thoroughly before deployment. In this work, we present an adaptive fuzzer for smart contracts on the Ethereum platform called sFuzz. Compared to existing Solidity fuzzers, sFuzz combines the strategy in the AFL fuzzer and an efficient lightweight multi-objective adaptive strategy targeting those hard-to-cover branches. sFuzz has been applied to more than 4 thousand smart contracts and the experimental results show that (1) sFuzz is efficient, e.g., two order of magnitudes faster than state-of-the-art tools; (2) sFuzz is effective in achieving high code coverage and discovering vulnerabilities; and (3) the different fuzzing strategies in sFuzz complement each other."

      "Abstract": "Metamodels play a significant role to describe and analyze the relations between domain concepts. They are also cornerstone to build a software language (SL) for a domain and its associated tooling. Metamodel definition generally drives code generation of a core API. The latter is further enriched by developers with additional code implementing advanced functionalities, e.g., checkers, recommenders, etc. When a SL is evolved to the next version, the metamodels are evolved as well before to re-generate the core API code. As a result, the developers added code both in the core API and the SL toolings may be impacted and thus may need to be co-evolved accordingly. Many approaches support the co-evolution of various artifacts when metamodels evolve. However, not the co-evolution of code. This paper fills this gap. We propose a semi-automatic co-evolution approach based on change propagation. The premise is that knowledge of the metamodel evolution changes can be propagated by means of resolutions to drive the code co-evolution. Our approach leverages on the abstraction level of metamodels where a given metamodel element has often different usages in the code. It supports alternative co-evaluations to meet different developers needs. Our work is evaluated on three Eclipse SL implementations, namely OCL, Modisco, and Papyrus over several evolved versions of metamodels and code. In response to five different evolved metamodels, we co-evolved caused impacts on 18 projects. A comparison of our co-evolved code with the versioned ones shows the usefulness of our approach, while supporting useful alternative co-evolution that developers have manually performed."

Although ``learning by doing\u0027\u0027 is widely advocated to address this topic’s abstract and fuzzy nature, educators are still facing various difficulties in practice, especially including students’ vicious circle of inexperience and the mental model dilemma in experiential learning. \n\\textbf{Aims:} To help break the aforementioned vicious circle and mental model dilemma, this work aims to investigate our educational strategy of using lightweight projects with public and free PaaS resources (1) to help students accumulate architectural experience from the early stage and (2) to facilitate strengthening students’ fundamental architecture knowledge. \n\\textbf{Method:} To collect more empirical evidence, we conducted action research on our educational strategy across three undergraduate-curriculum courses for two years. In particular, we employed the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to validate how well students received such an educational strategy. \n\\textbf{Results:} The students involved in the relevant coursework generally gave positive feedback with respect to learning theoretical concepts and a set of architectural patterns. Meanwhile, we also observed diverse learning curves for utilizing PaaS resources. \n\\textbf{Conclusions:} Although there still exist PaaS-related limits, our educational strategy can foster students’ experiential learning and collaborative learning in fundamental architecture courses. We believe that there are also potentials to extend our work to broader and advanced courses of software architecture."

      "Abstract": "Bug-related user reviews of mobile applications are highly regarded by developers for their negative influence on apps. Before bug fixing, developers need to manually reproduce the bugs reported in user reviews, which is an extremely time-consuming and tedious task. Hence, it is highly expected to relieve developers from it with some automated approaches. However, it is challenging to achieve the goal since user reviews are hard to understand and poorly informative for bug reproduction (especially lack of reproduction steps). In this paper, we propose \\ToolName{} to automatically \\textbf{Rep}roduce Android application bugs from user \\textbf{Rev}iews. Specifically, \\ToolName{} leverages natural language processing techniques to extract valuable information for bug reproduction. % A semantic similarity algorithm is designed to bridge the lexical gap between natural language and the application. % And, a one-step exploration technique is designed to search the actions of bug reproduction, which are missed in user reviews. Then, it ranks GUI components by semantic similarity with the user review and dynamically searches on apps with a novel one-step exploration technique. In the experiments, we generate a benchmark including 63 crash-related user reviews from Google Play, which have been reproduced successfully by three graduate students. On this benchmark, \\ToolName{} presents comparable performance with humans, which successfully reproduces 44 user reviews in our benchmark (about 70%) with 432.2 seconds average time. We make the implementation of our approach publicly available, along with the artifacts and experimental data we used~\\cite{RepRev}. \\end{abstract}"

      "Abstract": "This paper presents TransRepair, a fully automatic approach for testing and repairing the consistency of machine translation systems. TransRepair combines mutation with metamorphic testing to detect inconsistency bugs (without access to human oracles). It then adopts probability-reference or cross-reference to post-process the translations, in a grey-box or black-box manner, to repair the inconsistencies. Our evaluation on two state-of-the-art translators, Google Translate and Transformer, indicates that TransRepair has a high precision (99%) on generating input pairs with consistent translations. With these tests, using automatic consistency metrics and manual assessment, we find that Google Translate and Transformer have approximately 38% and 42% inconsistency bugs. Black-box repair fixes 28% and 19% bugs on average for Google Translate and Transformer. Grey-box repair fixes 30% bugs on average for Transformer. Manual inspection indicates that the translations repaired by our approach improve consistency in 87% of cases (degrading it in 2%), and that our repairs have better translation quality in 27% of the cases (worse in 8%)."

      "Abstract": "Over the past decade, deep learning (DL) has achieved a big performance leap in company with the booming of big data. While it has been successfully applied to some industrial domain-specific tasks (e.g., face recognition, speech recognition), its quality and reliability raise great concern especially in the context of safety- and security-critical scenarios. Adversarial examples (AEs) represent a typical and important type of defects needed to be urgently resolved, on which a DL software makes incorrect decisions. Such defects can occur through either intentional manipulation of adversarial attack or physical-world noise perceived by input sensors, potentially hindering the industry deployment. The intrinsic uncertainty nature of deep learning decision could be a fundamental reason for its incorrect behavior. Although many testing, adversarial attack and defense techniques have been proposed, it still lacks a systematic study to uncover the relationship between AEs and DL uncertainty. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study towards bridging this gap. We first investigate the capability of multiple uncertainty metrics on differentiating natural benign examples (BEs) and AEs. Then, we identify and categorize the uncertainty patterns of AEs and BEs, and find that while natural BEs and AEs generated by existing methods do follow common uncertainty patterns, some other uncertainty patterns are largely missed. Based on this, we propose an automated testing technique to generate multiple types of uncommon AEs and BEs. Our further evaluation reveals that the uncommon data generated by our methods is hard to be defensed by the state-of-the-art defense techniques with the average defense success rate reduced by 35%. Our results call for attention to generate more diverse data for evaluating and designing quality and reliable assurance solutions for DL software."

      "Abstract": "Gamification is the exploitation of game mechanisms for serious applications. In general they target societal challenges by engaging people in game-like scenarios. These mechanisms are so successful that there exists a growing interest in exploiting gamification in other scenarios where in general the fundamental need is enhancing people self-motivation. Notably, a major engagement could be necessary for students attending courses, employees with decreasing enthusiasm for their work, users lacking interest for certain applications, and so forth. In this respect, even though there exist disparate solutions to create gameful applications, they are intended to be built from scratch and stand-alone. This paper instead proposes a line of research, in the software engineering field by which gameful mechanisms can be bound to existing software applications to create gamified scenarios. In this way, potential adopters are only required to define the game elements and how they should be combined, while the remaining game automation part is obtained for free. Interestingly, this approach not only simplifies the adoption of gamification elements in pre-existing applications, but it also discloses the opportunity of enhancing the engineering of gameful applications as well as the management of the combination of multiple games."

      "Abstract": "Software Composition Analysis (SCA) has gained traction in recent years with a number of commercial offerings from various companies. SCA involves vulnerability curation process where a group of security researchers, using various data sources, populate a database of open-source library vulnerabilities, which is used by a scanner to inform the end users of vulnerable libraries used by their applications. One of the data sources used is the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The key challenge faced by the security researchers here is in figuring out which libraries are related to each of the reported vulnerability in NVD. In this article, we report our design and implementation of a machine learning system to help identify the libraries related to each vulnerability in NVD. \nThe problem is that of extreme multi-label learning (XML), and we developed our system using the state-of-the-art FastXML algorithm. Our system is iteratively executed, improving the performance of the model over time. At the time of writing, it achieves F1@1 score of 0.53 with average F1@k score for k\u003d1, 2, 3 of 0.51 (F1@k is the harmonic mean of precision@k and recall@k). It has been deployed in Veracode as part of a machine learning system that helps the security researchers identify the likelihood of web data items to be vulnerability-related. In addition, we present evaluation results of our feature engineering and the FastXML tree number used. Our work formulates for the first time library name identification from NVD data as XML and it is also the first attempt at solving it in a complete production system."

      "Abstract": "In this paper, we describe a strategy called design tracing, which trains students to comprehend class and sequence diagrams by tracing different scenarios. In design tracing, for a given scenario, students identify relevant variables from the class diagram, relevant events from the sequence diagram and trace the flow of these data variables, their values and events by constructing a state diagram. We have developed a web-based learning environment - VeriSIM, which trains learners to apply design tracing to trace scenarios. We conducted a study where 88 final-year undergraduates interacted with VeriSIM. Participants took a post-test after interacting with VeriSIM. Results from the post-test show that after interacting with VeriSIM, students are able to identify relevant events, but around 50% of the students still had difficulties in identifying relevant variables and constructing the state diagram. A focus-group interview was also conducted with 13 participants in order to understand participants’ perception of the usefulness of the design tracing strategy. A thematic analysis of the focus-group interview showed that students perceived that design tracing helped them understand the relationship between different diagrams and identify different scenarios in the design. Interaction with VeriSIM also helped students understand the usefulness of creating class and sequence diagrams. These results show that design tracing can be a useful pedagogy to help learners form an integrated and correct understanding of class and sequence design diagrams."

      "Abstract": "For much of its existence, software engineering has not had to deal directly with safety. Software is an abstraction and abstractions do not directly harm anyone or anything: it does not explode, catch on fire, or exude toxins. It can, of course, indirectly cause harm by providing unsafe control over physical processes that are directly dangerous. But until relatively recently, software was used to control dangerous physical processes only in limited and constrained circumstances. That genie has been let out of the bottle and nearly every dangerous system is now controlled by software. In this presentation, I will describe what needs to be done to limit the damage done by software and the new practices that are required to deal with the problem."

      "Abstract": "Message passing is the primary programming paradigm in high-performance computing. However, developing message passing programs is challenging due to the non-determinism caused by parallel execution and complex programming features such as non-deterministic communications and asynchrony. We present MPI-SV, a symbolic verifier for verifying the parallel C programs using message passing interface (MPI). MPI-SV combines symbolic execution and model checking in a synergistic manner to improve the scalability and enlarge the scope of verifiable properties. We have applied MPI-SV to real-world MPI C programs. The experimental results indicate that MPI-SV can, on average, achieve 19x speedups in verifying deadlock-freedom and 5x speedups in finding counter-examples. MPI-SV can be accessed at https://mpi-sv.github.io, and the demonstration video is at https://youtu.be/zzCY0CPDNCw."

We present similarities and differences between code clones in general and code clones on Stack Overflow and point to open questions that need to be addressed to be able to make data-informed decisions about how to handle clones on this important platform.

      "Abstract": "Code smells are sub-optimal implementation choices applied by developers that have the effect of negatively impacting, among others, the change-proneness of the affected classes. Based on this consideration, in this paper we conjecture that code smell-related information can be effectively exploited to improve the performance of change prediction models, i.e., models having the goal of indicating which classes are more likely to change in the future. We exploit the so-called intensity index—a previously defined metric that captures the severity of a code smell—and evaluate its contribution when added as additional feature in the context of three state of the art change prediction models based on product, process, and developer-based features. We also compare the performance achieved by the proposed model with a model based on previously defined antipattern metrics, a set of indicators computed considering the history of code smells in files. Our results report that (i) the prediction performance of the intensity-including models is statistically better than the baselines and, (ii) the intensity is a better predictor than antipattern metrics. We observed some orthogonality between the set of change-prone and non-change-prone classes correctly classified by the models relying on intensity and antipattern metrics: for this reason, we also devise and evaluate a smell-aware combined change prediction model including product, process, developer-based, and smell-related features. We show that the F-Measure of this model is notably higher than other models."

      "Abstract": "Software engineering involves writing new code or editing existing code. Recent efforts have investigated the neural processes associated with reading and comprehending code—however, we lack a thorough understanding of the human cognitive processes underlying code writing. While prose reading and writing have been studied thoroughly, that same scrutiny has not been applied to code writing. In this paper, we leverage functional brain imaging to investigate neural representations of code writing in comparison to prose writing. We present the first human study in which participants wrote and edited code and prose while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scan, making use of a full-sized fMRI-safe QWERTY keyboard. \nWe find that code writing and prose writing are significantly dissimilar neural tasks. While prose writing entails significant left hemisphere activity associated with language, code writing involves more activations of the right hemisphere, including regions associated with attention control, working memory, planning and spatial cognition. These findings are unlike existing work in which code and prose comprehension were studied. By contrast, we present the first evidence suggesting that code and prose \\emph{writing} are quite dissimilar at the neural level."

      "Abstract": "Technical debt is a metaphor to reflect the tradeoff software engineers make between short term benefits and long term stability. Self-admitted technical debt (SATD) [2], a variant of technical debt, has been proposed to identify debt that is intentionally introduced during software development, e.g., temporary fixes and workarounds. Previous studies have leveraged human-summarized patterns (which represent n-gram phrases that can be used to identify SATD) or text mining techniques to detect SATD in source code comments. However, several characteristics of SATD features in code comments, such as vocabulary diversity, project uniqueness, length and semantic variations, pose a big challenge to the accuracy of pattern or traditional text-mining based SATD detection, especially for cross-project deployment [1]. Further more, although traditional text-mining based method outperforms pattern-based method in prediction accuracy, the text features it uses are less intuitive than human-summarized patterns, which makes the prediction results hard to explain. In this paper, we first identify five characteristics of SATD comments that affect the performance, generalizability and adaptability of pattern-based SATD detection [2] and traditional text-mining based SATD classification [1]. To improve the accuracy of SATD prediction, especially for cross-project prediction, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach for classifying code comments as SATD or non-SATD. To improve the explainability of our model’s prediction results, we exploit the computational structure of CNNs to identify key phrases and patterns in code comments that are most relevant to SATD. \nThe main contributions of this paper are: (1) We present a novel CNN-based approach to identify SATDs from source code comments, which is an imbalanced dataset. Our approach achieves a substantial improvement over text mining approaches in both within- and cross-project settings; (2) We have designed a backtracking method to extract and highlight key phrases and SATD patterns in the code comments, which can then be used to explain the SATD classification results by the CNN model; (3) We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate not only the performance of our approach, but also its generalizability and adaptability, as well as the intuitiveness and explainability of the CNN-learned SATD features and patterns."

      "Abstract": "The sheer complexity of web applications leaves open a large attack surface of business logic. Particularly, in some scenarios, developers have to expose a portion of the logic to the client-side in order to coordinate multiple parties (e.g. merchants, client users, and third-party payment services) involved in a business process. However, such client-side code can be tampered with on the fly, leading to business logic perturbations and financial loss. Although developers become familiar with concepts that the client should never be trusted, given the size and the complexity of the client-side code that may be even incorporated from third parties, it is extremely challenging to understand and pinpoint the vulnerability. To this end, we investigate client-side business flow tampering vulnerabilities and develop a dynamic analysis based approach to automatically identifying such vulnerabilities. We evaluate our technique on $200$ popular real-world websites. With negligible overhead, we have successfully identified $27$ unique vulnerabilities on $23$ websites, such as New York Times, HBO, and YouTube, where an adversary can interrupt business logic to bypass paywalls, disable adblocker detection, earn reward points illicitly, etc."

      "Abstract": "Performance is one of the important aspects of software quality. Performance issues exist widely in software systems, and the process of fixing the performance issues is an essential step in the release cycle of software systems. Although performance testing is widely adopted in practice, it is still expensive and time-consuming. In particular, the performance testing is usually conducted after the system is built in a dedicated testing environment. The challenges of performance testing make it difficult to fit into the common DevOps process in software development. On the other hand, there exist a large number of tests readily available, that are executed regularly within the release pipeline during software development. In this paper, we perform an exploratory study to determine whether such readily available tests are capable of serving as performance tests. In particular, we would like to see whether the performance of these tests can demonstrate performance improvements obtained from fixing real-life performance issues. We collect 127 performance issues from Hadoop and Cassandra, and evaluate the performance of the readily available tests from the commits before and after the performance issue fixes. We find that most of the improvements from the fixes to performance issues can be demonstrated using the readily available tests in the release pipeline. However, only a very small portion of the tests can be used for demonstrating the improvements. By manually examining the tests, we identify eight reasons that a test cannot demonstrate performance improvements even though it covers the changed source code of the issue fix. Finally, we build random forest classifiers determining the important metrics influencing the readily available tests (not) being able to demonstrate performance improvements from issue fixes. We find that the test code itself and the source code covered by the test are important factors, while the factors related to the code changes in the performance issues fixes have a low importance. Practitioners may focus on designing and improving the tests, instead of fine-tuning tests for different performance issues fixes. Our findings can be used as a guideline for practitioners to reduce the amount of effort spent on leveraging and designing tests that run in the release pipeline for performance assurance activities."

      "Abstract": "Multithreaded programs can have deadlocks, even after deployment, so users may want to run deadlock tools on deployed programs. However, current deadlock predictors such as MagicLock and UnDead have large overheads that make them impractical for end-user deployment and confine their use to development time. Such overhead stems from running an exponential-time algorithm on a large execution trace. In this paper, we present the first low-overhead deadlock predictor, called AirLock, that is fit for both in-house testing and deployed programs. AirLock maintains a small predictive lock reachability graph, searches the graph for cycles, and runs an exponential-time algorithm only for each cycle. This approach lets AirLock find the same deadlocks as MagicLock and UnDead but with much less overhead because the number of cycles is small in practice. Our experiments with real-world benchmarks show that the average time overhead of AirLock is 3.5%, which is three orders of magnitude less than that of MagicLock and UnDead. AirLock’s low overhead makes it suitable for use with fuzz testers like AFL and on-the-fly after deployment."

How these code fixing techniques impacts the robustness of these systems has not been clear. Does fixing code increase the robustness? Do they deteriorate the learning capability of the DL based systems? To answer these questions, we studied 321 Stack Overflow posts based on a published dataset. In this study, we built a classification scheme to analyze how bug-fixes change the robustness of the DL model and found that most of the bug-fixes can increase the robustness. We also found evidence of bug-fixing that decrease the robustness. Our preliminary result suggests that 12.5% and 2.4% of the bug-fixes in Stack Overflow posts caused the increase and the decrease of the robustness of DL models respectively."

Control engineers design and implement software for such systems using standardized programming languages (IEC 61131-3) and still require substantial manual work causing high engineering costs and potential quality issues. Methods for automatically generating control logic using knowledge extraction from formal requirements documents have been developed, but so far only been demonstrated in simplified lab settings. We have executed four case studies on large industrial plants with thousands of sensors and actuators for a rule-based control logic generation approach called CAYENNE to determine its practicability. We found that we can generate more than 70 percent of the required interlocking control logic with code generation rules that are applicable across different plants. This can lead to estimated overall development cost savings of up to 21 percent, which provides a promising outlook for methods in this class."

      "Abstract": "API usage directives in official API documentation describe the contracts, constraints and guidelines for using APIs in natural language. Through the investigation of API misuse scenarios on Stack Overflow, we identify three barriers that hinder the understanding of the API usage directives, i.e., lack of specific usage context, indirect relationships to cooperative APIs, and confusing APIs with subtle differences. To overcome these barriers, we develop a text mining approach to discover the crowdsourced API misuse scenarios on Stack Overflow and extract from these scenarios erroneous code examples and patches, as well as related API and confusing APIs to construct demystification reports to help developers understand the official API usage directives described in natural language. We apply our approach to API usage directives in official Android API documentation and android-tagged discussion threads on Stack Overflow. We extract 159,116 API misuse scenarios for 23,969 API usage directives of 3138 classes and 7471 methods, from which we generate the demystification reports. Our manual examination confirms that the extracted information in the generated demystification reports are of high accuracy. By a user study of 14 developers on 8 API-misuse related error scenarios, we show that our demystification reports help developer understand and debug API-misuse related program errors faster and more accurately, compared with reading only plain API usage-directive sentences."

      "Abstract": "As Android platform evolves in a fast pace, API-related compatibility issues become a significant challenge for developers. Existing works mainly focus on detecting whether an app performs sufficient checks to avoid invoking incompatible APIs on platforms that do not support them. Besides checking the presence of compatibility issues, another important problem is how to fix/work-around these issues. To shed light on the current practice of fixing evolution-induced API compatibility issues, this paper performs the first large-scale study of compatibility issues for about 300,000 Android market apps, and more importantly, their solutions (if exist). However, it is in general very challenging to determine if developers have put in counter-measure for a compatibility issue, as different APIs have diverse behaviors, rendering various repair. We propose a learning-based approach, RAPID, that leverages static analysis and machine learning to build a classifier to determine if a compatibility issue has been addressed. Results show that the trained classifier is quite effective by achieving a F1-score of 95.21% and 91.96% in the training stage and the validation stage respectively. With the help of RAPID, our study yields a number of interesting findings, e.g. only 38.4% of the incompatible API uses are actually provided alternative implementation as a fix; the fix ratio for incompatible APIs with Google recommendations is significantly higher than those without recommendations, but Google only provides recommendations for very few APIs; developers find more ways to repair such issues than Google’s recommendations and there is a large room to improve the current status of compatibility issue handling."

In this talk I will provide an overview of some mobile robotic platforms and frameworks that we have targeted to ground our research efforts in addressing these challenges, the range of properties that those systems are meant to satisfy from robustness to ethical concerns, and the body of techniques we have developed to address those challenges that span from type analysis to oracle analysis, and from DNN verification to trajectory and environment generation."

      "Abstract": "Code injection attacks, like the one used in the high-profile 2017 Equifax breach, have become increasingly common, now ranking #1 on OWASP’s list of critical web application vulnerabilities. Static analyses for detecting these vulnerabilities can overwhelm developers with false positive reports. Meanwhile, most dynamic analyses rely on detecting vulnerabilities as they occur in the field, which can introduce a high performance overhead in production code. This paper describes a new approach for detecting injection vulnerabilities in applications by harnessing the combined power of both human developers test suites and automated dynamic analysis. Our new approach, RIVULET, monitors the execution of developer-written functional tests in order to detect information flows that may be vulnerable to attack. Then, RIVULET uses a white-box test generation technique to repurpose those functional tests to check if any vulnerable flow could be exploited. When applied to the version of Apache Struts exploited in the 2017 Equifax attack, RIVULET quickly identifies the vulnerability, leveraging only the tests that existed in Struts at that time. We compared RIVULET to the state-of-the-art static vulnerability detector Julia on benchmarks, finding that RIVULET outperformed Julia in both false positives and false negatives. We also use RIVULET to detect previously unknown vulnerabilities."

      "Abstract": "Background: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software was originally conceived for manufacturing contexts and has later been generalized to cover service contexts as well. In hospitals, adoption was accelerated by an increasing commodification and marketization of health care. \nQuestion: What impact do the manufacturing roots of SAP ERP have when the software is applied for service delivery in a hospital? \nMethod: A typical-case Yin Case Study about the surgery planning and execution processes in a large university hospital. \nResults: One goal of the ERP implementation was to optimize the utilization of the operation rooms (ORs). This goal was largely missed because of too-low quality of planning data effectuated intentionally by the surgeons in order to pursue micropolitical agendas. This was possible because the software paid no attention to micropolitics at all, largely due to its roots in manufacturing and hidden by higher software layers that claimed to be adapted to the hospital domain. \nConclusions: Apparently, successful complex reusable application software can create a domain paradigm that subsequently creates product risk by being inappropriately and neglectfully extended into other domains where it does not apply. Software engineering should become aware of this effect and perform research to control it."

      "Abstract": "Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchain platforms, provides financial transactions like payments and auctions through smart contracts. Due to the tremendous interest in smart contracts in academia, the research community of smart contract security has made a significant improvement recently. Researchers have reported various security vulnerabilities in smart contracts, and developed static analysis tools and verification frameworks to detect them. However, it is unclear whether such great efforts from academia has indeed enhanced the security of smart contracts in reality. \nIn this paper, we empirically studied how secure real-world smart contracts are in the case of the Solidity programming language. We first examined how many well-known vulnerabilities the Solidity compiler has patched, and how frequently the Solidity team publishes compiler releases. Unfortunately, we observed that many known vulnerabilities are not yet patched, and some patches are not even sufficient to avoid their target vulnerabilities. Subsequently, we investigated whether smart contract developers use the most recent compiler with vulnerabilities patched. We reported that developers of more than 98% of real-world Solidity contracts still use older compilers without vulnerability patches, and more than 25% of the contracts are potentially vulnerable due to the missing security patches. To understand actual impacts of the missing patches, we manually investigated potentially vulnerable contracts, and identified common mistakes by Solidity developers, which may cause serious security issues such as financial loss. We reported hundreds of vulnerable contracts: three have been assigned CVE IDs, and more are requested. About one fourth of the vulnerable contracts are used by thousands of people. We recommend the Solidity team to make patches that resolve known vulnerabilities correctly, and developers to use the latest Solidity compiler to avoid missing security patches."

      "Abstract": "The Android OS market is experiencing a growing share globally. It is becoming the mobile platform of choice for an increasing number of users. People rely on Android mobile devices for surfing the web, purchasing products, or to be part of a social network. The large amount of personal information that is exchanged makes privacy an important concern. As a result, the trustability of mobile apps is a fundamental aspect to be considered, particularly with regard to meeting the expectations of end users. The rigidities of the Android permission model confine end users into a secondary role, offering the only option of choosing between either privacy or functionalities. In this paper, we aim at improving the trustability of Android apps by proposing a user-centric approach to the flexible management of Android permissions.The proposed approach empowers end users to selectively grant permission by specifying (i) the desired level of permissions granularity and (ii) the specific features of the app in which the chosen permission levels are granted. Four experiments have been designed, conducted, and reported for evaluating it. The experiments consider performance, usability, and acceptance from both the end user’s and developer’s perspective. Results confirm confidence on the approach."

As software development gradually shifts to the development of data analytics with AI and ML technologies, existing software engineering techniques must be re-imagined to provide the productivity gains that developers desire. We conducted a large scale study of almost 800 professional data scientists in software industry to investigate what a data scientist is, what data scientists do, and what challenges they face. This study has found that ensuring correctness is a huge problem in data analytics. Software developers currently do not have a good method for increasing confidence on the quality of data analytics development. We argue for re-targeting software engineering tools and research directions to address new challenges in the era of data-centric software development. We showcase a few examples of software engineering techniques that re-invent automated debugging and testing for data analytics. In particular, we discuss interactive debugging primitives, automated debugging, data provenance, and symbolic-execution based test generation for big data analytics in Apache Spark. We conclude with open problems in software engineering to support data-centric software development and the needs of AI and ML workforce."

      "Abstract": "Successful cross-language clone detection could enable researchers and developers to create robust language migration tools, facilitate learning additional programming languages once one is mastered, and promote reuse of code snippets over a broader code base. However, identifying cross-language clones presents special challenges to the clone detection problem. A lack of common underlying representation between arbitrary languages means detecting clones requires one of the following solutions: 1) a static analysis framework replicated across each targeted language with annotations matching language features across all languages, or 2) a dynamic analysis framework that detects clones based on runtime behavior. \nIn this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of the latter solution, a dynamic analysis approach for cross-language clone detection. As an added challenge, we target a static typed language, Java, and a dynamic typed language, Python. As is done in prior clone detection work, we use input/output behavior to match clones, though we overcome limitations of prior work by amplifying the number of inputs and covering more data types; and as a result, achieve better clusters than prior attempts. Compared to HitoshiIO, a recent clone detection tool, SLACC retrieves 6x as many clusters and has higher precision (86.7% vs. 30.7%). \nThis is the first work to perform clone detection for dynamic typed languages (precision \u003d 87.3%) and the first to perform clone detection across languages that lack a common underlying representation (precision \u003d 94.1%). It provides a first step towards the larger goal of extensible and scalable language migration tools."

      "Abstract": "High energy consumption is a challenging issue that an ever increasing number of mobile applications face today. However, energy consumption is being tested in an ad hoc way, despite being an important non-functional requirement of an application. Such limitation becomes particularly disconcerting during software testing: on the one hand, developers do not really know how to measure energy; on the other hand, there is no knowledge as to what is the energy overhead imposed by the testing framework. \nIn this paper, we design a methodology to measure the energy consumption of eight popular UI testing frameworks within six typical interactions and three helper methods. We have discovered that there are automation frameworks that increase energy consumption up to roughly 2200%. While limited in the interactions one can do, Espresso is observed to be the most energy-efficient framework. However, depending on the needs of the tester, Appium, Monkeyrunner, or UIAutomator are good alternatives. \nIn practice, results show that deciding which is the most suitable framework is vital. We provide a decision tree to help developers make an educated decision on which framework suits best their testing needs. Finally, we show that helper methods to find components in the interface – i.e., lookup methods – should be minimized to prevent affecting energy results. In particular, lookup methods based on the content of the UI component need to be avoided. They consistently yield poor energy efficiency when compared to lookups based on id (e.g., in Espresso it creates an overhead of 600%)."

      "Abstract": "Recent research in empirical software engineering is applying techniques from neurocognitive science and breaking new grounds in the ways that researchers can model and analyze the cognitive processes of developers as they interact with software artifacts. However, given the novelty of this line of research, only one tool exists to help researchers represent and analyze this kind of multimodal biometric data. While this tool does help with visualizing temporal eyetracking and physiological data, it does not allow for the mapping of physiological data to source code elements, instead projecting information over images of code. One drawback of this is that researchers are still unable to meaningfully combine and map physiological and eye tracking data to source code artifacts. The use of images also bars the support of long or multiple code files, which prevents researchers from analyzing data from experiments conducted in realistic settings. To address these drawbacks, we propose VITALSE, a tool for the interactive visualization of combined multi-modal biometric data for software engineering tasks. VITALSE provides interactive and customizable temporal heatmaps created with synchronized eyetracking and biometric data. The tool supports analysis on multiple files, user defined annotations for points of interest over source code elements, and high level customizable metric summaries for the provided dataset. VITALSE, a video demonstration, and sample data to demonstrate its capabilities can be found at http://www.vitalse.app."

      "Abstract": "Quantum computers are becoming more mainstream. As more programmers are starting to look at writing quantum programs, they face an inevitable task of debugging their code. How should the programs for quantum computers be debugged? \nIn this paper, we discuss existing debugging tactics, used in developing programs for classic computers, and show which ones can be readily adopted. We also highlight QC-specific debugging issues and list novel techniques that are needed to address these issues. The practitioners can readily apply some of these tactics to their process of writing quantum programs, while researchers can learn about opportunities for future work."

      "Abstract": "Technical debt (TD), its impact on development and its consequences such as defects and vulnerabilities, are of common interest and great importance to software researchers and practitioners. Although there exist many studies investigating TD, the majority of them focuses on identifying and detecting TD from a single stage of development. There are also studies that analyze vulnerabilities focusing on some phases of the life cycle. Moreover, several approaches have investigated the relationship between TD and vulnerabilities, however, the generalizability and validity of findings are limited due to small dataset. In this study, we aim to identify TD through multiple phases of development, and to automatically measure it through data and text mining techniques to form a comprehensive feature model. We plan to utilize neural network based classifiers that will incorporate evolutionary changes on TD measures into predicting vulnerabilities. Our approach will be empirically assessed on open source and industrial projects."

      "Abstract": "Image classifiers have become an important component of today’s software, from consumer and business applications to safety-critical domains. The advent of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the key catalyst behind such wide-spread success. However, wide adoption comes with serious concerns about the robustness of software systems dependent on image classification DNNs, as several severe erroneous behaviors have been reported under sensitive and critical circumstances. We argue that developers need to rigorously test their software’s image classifiers and delay deployment until acceptable. We present an approach to testing image classifier robustness based on class property violations. \nWe have found that many of the reported erroneous cases in popular DNN image classifiers occur because the trained models confuse one class with another or show biases towards some classes over others. These bugs usually violate some class properties of one or more of those classes. Most DNN testing techniques focus on per-image violations and thus fail to detect such class-level confusions or biases. \nWe developed a testing approach to automatically detect class-based confusion and bias errors in DNN-driven image classification software. We evaluated our implementation, DeepInspect, on several popular image classifiers with precision up to 100% (avg. 72.6%) for confusion errors, and up to 84.3% (avg. 66.8%) for bias errors. DeepInspect found hundreds of classification mistakes in widely-used models, many of which expose errors indicating confusion or bias."

      "Abstract": "Modern machine learning programs are often written in Python, with the main computations specified through calls to some highly optimized libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). How to maximize the computing efficiency of such programs is essential for many application domains, which has drawn lots of recent attention. This work points out a common limitation in existing efforts: they focus their views only on the static computation graphs specified by library APIs, but leave the influence from the hosting Python code largely unconsidered. The limitation often causes them to miss the big picture and hence many important optimization opportunities. This work proposes a new approach named HARP to address the problem. HARP enables holistic analysis that spans across computation graphs and their hosting Python code. HARP achieves it through a set of novel techniques: analytics-conscious speculative analysis to circumvent Python complexities, a unified representation augmented computation graphs to capture all dimensions of knowledge related with the holistic analysis, and conditioned feedback mechanism to allow risk-controlled aggressive analysis. Refactoring based on HARP gives 1.3–3X and 2.07X average speedups on a set of TensorFlow and PyTorch programs."

      "Abstract": "Detecting regression bugs in software evolution, analyzing side-channels in programs and evaluating robustness in deep neural networks (DNNs) can all be seen as instances of differential software analysis, where the goal is to generate diverging executions of program paths. Two executions are said to be diverging if the observable program behavior differs, e.g., in terms of program output, execution time, or (DNN) classification. The key challenge of differential software analysis is to simultaneously reason about multiple program paths, often across program variants. \nThis paper presents HyDiff, the first hybrid approach for differential software analysis. HyDiff integrates and extends two very successful testing techniques: Feedback-directed greybox fuzzing for efficient program testing and shadow symbolic execution for systematic program exploration. HyDiff extends greybox fuzzing with divergence-driven feedback based on novel cost metrics that take into account the control flow graph of the program. Furthermore HyDiff extends shadow symbolic execution by applying four-way forking in a systematic exploration and still having the ability to incorporate concrete inputs in the analysis. HyDiff applies divergence revealing heuristics based on resource consumption and control-flow information to efficiently guide the symbolic exploration, which allows its efficient usage beyond regression testing applications. We introduce differential metrics such as output, decision and cost difference, as well as patch distance, to assist the fuzzing and symbolic execution components in maximizing the execution divergence. \nWe implemented our approach on top of the fuzzer AFL and the symbolic execution framework Symbolic PathFinder. We illustrate HyDiff on regression and side-channel analysis for Java bytecode programs, and further show how to use HyDiff for robustness analysis of neural networks."

In this paper we introduce a large taxonomy of faults in deep learning (DL) systems. We have manually analysed 1059 artefacts gathered from GitHub commits and issues of projects that use the most popular DL frameworks (TensorFlow, Keras and PyTorch) and from related Stack Overflow posts. Structured interviews with 20 researchers and practitioners describing the problems they have encountered in their experience have enriched our taxonomy with a variety of additional faults that did not emerge from the other two sources. Our final taxonomy was validated with a survey involving an additional set of 21 developers, confirming that almost all fault categories (13/15) were experienced by at least 50% of the survey participants."

We argue that a distinction is valuable, as applications, goals, and challenges differ fundamentally between feature flags and configuration options. In this work, we explore the differences and commonalities of both concepts to help understand practices and challenges and to help transfer existing solutions (e.g., for testing). To better understand feature flags and how they relate to configuration options, we performed nine semi-structured interviews with feature-flag experts. We discovered a number of distinguishing characteristics but also opportunities for knowledge and technology transfer across both communities. Overall, we think that both communities can learn from each other."

      "Abstract": "Many big-data applications are batch applications that exploit dedicated frameworks to perform massively parallel computations across clusters of machines. The time needed to process the entirety of the inputs represents the application’s response time, which can be subject to deadlines. Spark, probably the most famous incarnation of these frameworks today, allocates resources to applications statically at the beginning of the execution and deviations are not managed: to meet the applications’ deadlines, resources must be allocated carefully. Our paper proposes an extension to Spark, called dynaSpark, that is able to allocate and redistribute resources to applications dynamically to meet deadlines and cope with the execution of unanticipated applications. This work is based on two key enablers: containers, to isolate Spark’s parallel executors and allow for the dynamic and fast allocation of resources, and control-theory to govern resource allocation at runtime and obtain required precision and speed. Our evaluation shows that dynaSpark can (i) allocate resources efficiently to execute single applications with respect to set deadlines and (ii) reduce deadline violations (w.r.t. Spark) when executing multiple concurrent applications."

We show that such hyperparameter optimization can be unnecessarily slow, particularly when the optimizers waste time exploring “redundant tunings”, i.e., pairs of tunings which lead to indistinguishable results. By ignoring redundant tunings, DODGE, a tuning tool, runs orders of magnitude faster, while also generating learners with more accurate predictions than seen in prior state-of-the-art approaches. \nThis paper was TSE-2019-01-0041.R2, accepted for publication to IEEE TSE, Sept 25, 2019.The paper is on-line at IEEE Xplore at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8854183.

For instance, since 2017 Android developers have the official support to write Android applications using Kotlin language. Kotlin is programming language fully interoperable with Java that combines object-oriented and functional features. Objective: The goal of this paper is twofold. First, it aims to study the degree of adoption of Kotlin language on development of open-source Android applications and to measure the amount of Kotlin code inside Android applications. Secondly, it aims to measure the quality of Android applications that are written using Kotlin and to compare it with the quality of Android applications written using Java. Method: We first defined a method to detect Kotlin applications from a dataset of open-source Android applications. Then, we analyzed those applications to detect instances of code smells and computed an estimation of quality of the applications. Finally, we studied how the introduction of Kotlin code impacts on the quality of an Android application. Results: Our experiment found that 11.26% of applications from a dataset with 2,167 open-source applications have been written (partially or fully) using Kotlin language. We found that the introduction of Kotlin code increases the quality (in terms of presence of code smells) of the majority of the Android applications initially written in Java."

      "Abstract": "Model-driven software engineering allows abstraction through the use of models and then automation by transforming them into various artefacts, in particular to code. For example, 1) from architectural models to code , 2) from metamoddels to API code with EMF in Eclipse, 3) from entity models to front-end and back-end code in jHispter, ect. In all these examples, the generated code is usually enriched by developers with additional code implementing advanced functionalities (e.g., checkers, recommenders, etc.) to build a full coherent system. When the system must evolve, the models are evolved before to re-generate the code. As a result, the developers’ enriched code may be impacted and thus may need to be co-evolved accordingly. Many approaches support the co-evolution of various artifacts, but, not the co-evolution of code. This paper sheds light on this issue and envisions to fill this gap. \nWe formulate the hypothesis that the code co-evolution can be driven by the model changes by means of change propagation. To investigate this hypothesis, we implemented a prototype for the use case of metamodels and their accompanying code in EMF Eclipse. As a preliminary evaluation, we considered as a case study the implementation of the OCL language in Eclipse. In particular, the case of the OCL Pivot metamodel evolution and its code co-evolution in two projects from version 3.2.2 to 3.4.4. Preliminary results confirms our hypothesis that evolution changes can effectively drive the code co-evolution. On 562 impacts in two projects’ code by 221 metamodel changes, our approach was able to reach 89% and 92,5% respectively of precision and recall."

      "Abstract": "Intelligent services are becoming increasingly more pervasive; application developers want to leverage the latest advances in areas such as computer vision to provide new services and products to users, and large technology firms enable this via RESTful APIs. While such APIs promise an easy-to-integrate on-demand machine intelligence, their current design, documentation and developer interface hides much of the underlying machine learning techniques that power them. Such APIs look and feel like conventional APIs but abstract away data-driven probabilistic behaviour—the implications of a developer treating these APIs in the same way as other, traditional cloud services, such as cloud storage, is of concern. The objective of this study is to determine the various pain-points developers face when implementing systems that rely on the most mature of these intelligent services, specifically those that provide computer vision. We use Stack Overflow to mine indications of the frustrations that developers appear to face when using computer vision services, classifying their questions against two recent classification taxonomies (documentation-related and general questions). We find that, unlike mature fields like mobile development, there is a contrast in the types of questions asked by developers. These indicate a shallow understanding of the underlying technology that empower such systems. We discuss several implications of these findings via the lens of learning taxonomies to suggest how the software engineering community can improve these services and comment on the nature by which developers use them."

      "Abstract": "Open source is ubiquitous and critical infrastructure, yet funding and sustaining it is challenging. While there are many different funding models for open-source donations and concerted efforts through foundations, donation platforms like PayPal, Patreon, or OpenCollective are popular and low-bar forms to raise funds for open-source development, for which GitHub recently even built explicit support. With a mixed-method study, we explore the emerging and largely unexplored phenomenon of donations in open source: We quantify how commonly open-source projects ask for donations, statistically model characteristics of projects that ask for and receive donations, analyze for what the requested funds are needed and used, and assess whether the received donations achieve the intended outcomes. We find 25,885 projects asking for donations on GitHub, often to support engineering activities; however, we also find no clear evidence that donations influence the activity level of a project. In fact, we find that donations are used in a multitude of ways, raising new research questions about effective funding."

      "Abstract": "DevOps, stands for Development-Operations. It arises from the IT industry as a movement aligning development and operations teams in “organizational structure, practices, and culture to enable rapid development and scalable, reliable operations” [1]. DevOps is broadly recognized as an IT standard, and there is high demand for DevOps practitioners in industry. Since ACM \u0026amp; IEEE suggest that undergraduate computer science curricula “must adequately prepare [students] for the workforce” [2], we studied whether undergraduates acquired adequate DevOps skills to fulfill the demand for DevOps practitioners in industry. We employed Grounded Theory (GT), a social science qualitative research methodology, to study DevOps education from academic and industrial perspectives. In academia, academics were not motivated to learn or adopt DevOps, therefore most institutions were not teaching DevOps. Academics need incentives to adopt DevOps, in order to stimulate interest in teaching DevOps. In industry, DevOps practitioners lack clearly defined roles and responsibilities, for the DevOps topic is diverse and growing too fast. Therefore, practitioners can only learn DevOps through hands-on working experience. In conclusion, academic institutions should provide fundamental DevOps education (in culture, procedure, and technology) to prepare students for their future DevOps advancement in industry. Based on our findings, we proposed five groups of future studies to advance DevOps education in academia."

      "Abstract": "Technical debt (TD) is an economical term used to depict non-optimal choices made in the software development process. Technical debt occurs usually when developers take shortcuts instead of following agreed upon development practices. Unchecked growth of technical debt can start to incur negative effects for software development processes such as extra costs, weakened working morale and motivation, making it difficult to implement new features to the existing programs, and substantial financial losses. \nTechnical debt management is mainly done manually, and this is both slow and costly way of detecting technical debt. Automatic detection would solve this issue, but even state-of-the-art tools of today do not accurately detect the appearance of technical debt. Therefore, increasing the accuracy of automatic classification is of high importance, so that we could eliminate significant portion from the costs relating to technical debt detection. \nThis research aims to solve the problem in detection accuracy by bringing in together static code analysis and natural language processing. This combination of techniques will allow more accurate detection of technical debt, when compared to them being used separately from each other. Research also aims to discover themes and topics from written developer messages that can be linked to technical debt. These can help us to understand technical debt from developers’ viewpoint. Finally, we will build an open-source tool/plugin that can be used to accurately detect technical debt using both static analysis and natural language processing methods."

Then, we propose CHASE, a checklist to facilitate UX evaluation in IoT scenarios. First, CHASE was constructed based on the results of a literature review that identified methods, instruments, and characteristics of user interaction and evaluation in these scenarios. Then, fourteen IoT experts reviewed a preliminary version of the check-list, followed by three Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) experts. Finally, to engage experts in testing CHASE in a real environment and to gather authentic feedback, three researchers evaluated a real IoT application using CHASE. In addition, this paper presents a series of important points for the evaluation of UX in IoT environments based on the literature review, the opinion of the experts, and the IoT application evaluations."

      "Abstract": "Test flakiness—inability to reliably repeat a test’s Pass/Fail outcome—continues to be a significant problem in Industry, adversely impacting continuous integration and test pipelines. Completely eliminating flaky tests is not a realistic option as a significant fraction of system tests (typically non-hermetic) for services-based implementations exhibit some level of flakiness. In this paper, we view the flakiness of a test as a rankable value, which we quantify, track and assign a confidence. We develop two ways to model flakiness, capturing the randomness of test results via entropy, and the temporal variation via flipRate, and aggregating these over time. We have implemented our flakiness scoring service and discuss how its adoption has impacted test suites of two large services at Apple. We show how flakiness is distributed across the tests in these services, including typical score ranges and outliers. The flakiness scores are used to monitor and detect changes in flakiness trends. Evaluation results demonstrate near perfect accuracy in ranking, identification and alignment with human interpretation. The scores were used to identify 2 causes of flakiness in the dataset evaluated, which have been confirmed, and where fixes have been implemented or are underway. Our models reduced flakiness by 44% with less than 1% loss in fault detection."

      "Abstract": "Developers write logging statements to generate logs and record system execution behaviors. Such logs are widely used for a variety of tasks, such as debugging, testing, program comprehension, and performance analysis. However, there exists no practical guidelines on how to write logging statements; hence, making the logging decision a very challenging task. There are two main challenges that developers are facing while making logging decisions: 1) Difficult to accurately and succinctly record execution behaviors; and 2) Hard to decide where to write logging statements. This thesis proposes a series of approaches to address the problems and help developers make logging decisions in two aspects: assist in making decisions on logging contents and on logging locations. Through case studies on large-scale open source and commercial systems, we anticipate that our study will provide useful suggestions and supports to developers for writing better logging statements."

The paper explains the steps taken through developing the Uffizi Museum crowd monitoring and queue management system. The goal of implementing such system was to remove queues outside the Museum which is in line with urban security and visitors comfort. We took advantage of a data-driven approach mapped on sustainability framework. Such approach which was fed with both real-time sensory data and prediction models, successfully eliminated long queues to access the museum. We took into consideration performance of software system as well to reduce the response time to a threshold that is compliant with real-time requirements. We started our experiences from fall 2016 and put in the field the system from October, 2018. During this experimentation period, we learned a lot of lessons that we report in this paper."

      "Abstract": "As LG home appliances promise more convenience features to end-users, the complexity of their control software is also increasing, creating a higher pressure for software verification. However, since the embedded software is tightly coupled with its hardware counterpart, the development and verification schedules are dependent upon hardware development and this hinders integration testing to be performed as thoroughly as it deserves. Furthermore, the manually-crafted test cases have had limitations, both in terms of the thoroughness of state-space exploration and the power of test oracles. \nTo overcome these problems and facilitate a more efficient software verification, we introduce a property-based testing framework using software-in-the-loop simulation (SILS). SILS allows the software to be integrated virtually and tested before the hardware is fully developed, and, further, it enables an acceleration in test executions of up to a few tens of thousand times. Property-based testing is achieved by translating the formalized properties to synchronous observers which can concurrently check the violation of the verification property during test executions. In the field application, we discovered two fault cases in real products under development using our framework. According to our analysis, these cases could not have been found using manual testing, but made possible by our testing framework. These cases could have cost the company tens of million dollars each, if they were not discovered until after sale."

      "Abstract": "The rapid adoption and the diversification of cloud computing technology exacerbate the importance of a sound experimental methodology for this domain. It has been a decade since the first commercial cloud has opened for a general public (Amazon AWS, in 2007). Cloud computing systems are now in much demand, and command significant industrial and scientific interest. Although scientific progress and industry growth depend on using sound principles for measuring and reporting cloud-system performance, this process remains complex. This work investigates how to measure and report performance in the cloud, and how well the cloud research community is already doing it. There are several difficulties, including controlling the time-accuracy trade-off, deciding which data to collect and to report, and using the right summarization statistics in the report. We propose a set of eight important methodological principles that combine best-practices from nearby fields with concepts applicable only to clouds, and with new ideas about the time-accuracy trade-off. We show how these principles are applicable using a practical use-case experiment. To this end, we analyze the ability of the newly released SPEC Cloud IaaS benchmark to follow the principles, and showcase real-world experimental studies in common cloud environments that meet the principles. Last, we report on a systematic literature review including top conferences and journals in the field, from 2012 to 2017, analyzing if the practice of reporting cloud performance measurements follows the proposed eight principles. Worryingly, this systematic survey and the subsequent two-round human reviews, reveal that few of the published studies follow the eight experimental principles. We conclude that, although these important principles are simple and basic, the cloud community is yet to adopt them broadly to deliver sound measurement of cloud environments."

      "Abstract": "Traceability is a fundamental component of the modern software development process that helps to ensure properly functioning, secure programs. However, traceability tasks incur high costs in terms of effort and time and are often prone to errors. This has prompted a wealth of research on automated approaches that draw relationships between pairs of textual software artifacts using similarity measures. Despite the progress made toward practical automation, such approaches currently have two major drawbacks that inhibit their effectiveness. Namely, current techniques typically only utilize a single measure of artifact similarity, and cannot simultaneously model (implicit and explicit) relationships across groups of diverse structured and unstructured development artifacts. \nIn this paper, we illustrate how these limitations can be overcome through the use of a tailored probabilistic model. To this end, we design and implement a HierarchiCal PrObabilistic Model for SoftwarE Traceability (Comet) that is able to predict candidate trace links. Comet is capable of modeling relationships between artifacts by combining the complimentary observational prowess of multiple measures of textual similarity. Additionally, our model can holistically incorporate information from a diverse set of sources, including developer expertise and transitive (often implicit) relationships among groups of software artifacts, to improve prediction accuracy. We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of Comet that illustrates our approach is consistently more effective across datasets than existing baseline techniques, and outperforms past approaches on average when considering multiple information sources. Additionally, we worked with a major telecommunication company to develop a Continuous Integration (CI) plugin implementing Comet. A survey with industry developers who used the Comet plugin illustrates its potential for practical applicability."

      "Abstract": "The increasing use of machine-learning (ML) enabled systems incritical tasks fuels the quest for novel verification and validation techniques yet grounded in accepted system assurance principles. In traditional system development, model-based techniques have been widely adopted, where the central premise is that abstract models of the required system provide a sound basis for judging its implementation. We posit an analogous approach for ML systems using an ML technique that extracts from the high-dimensional training data implicitly describing the required system, a low-dimensional underlying structure—a manifold. It is then harnessed for a range of quality assurance tasks such as test adequacy measurement, test input generation, and runtime monitoring of the target ML system.The approach is built on variational autoencoders, an unsupervised method for learning a pair of mutually near-inverse functions between a given high-dimensional dataset and a low-dimensional representation. Preliminary experiments establish that the proposedmanifold-based approach, for test adequacy drives diversity in testdata, for test generation yields fault-revealing yet realistic test casesand for run-time monitoring provides an independent means to assess trustability of the target system’s output."

      "Abstract": "Software application programming interfaces (APIs) are a ubiquitous part of Software Engineering. The evolution of these APIs requires constant effort from their developers and users alike. API developers must constantly struggle to keep their products modern whilst keeping them as stable as possible. Meanwhile, API users must continually be on the lookout to adapt to changes that could break their applications. As APIs become more numerous, users are challenged by a sea of choices and information on which API to use. Current research attempts to provide automatic documentation, code examples, and code completion to make API evolution more scalable for users. Our work will attempt to establish practical and scalable API evolution guidelines and tools based on public code repositories, to aid both API users and API developers. \nThis thesis focuses on investigating the use of public code repositories provided by the open-source community to improve software API engineering practices. More specifically, we seek to improve software engineering practices linked to API evolution both from the perspective of API users and API developers. To achieve this goal, we apply quantitative and qualitative research methods to understand the problems at hand. We then mine public code repositories granted to us by open-source software communities to develop novel solutions to these problems."

      "Abstract": "In our journal first paper “Is static analysis able to identify unnecessary source code?”, we investigate a major software maintenance issue, especially for grown software systems: code that is not necessary anymore. Such unnecessary code wastes resources during development and maintenance, for example, when preparing code for migration or certification. In the literature, execution information from production environments is used to identify code that is not used anymore. However, it is often time-consuming to obtain representative data in this way. In the journal paper, we investigate to what extent a static analysis approach, which is based on code stability and code centrality, is able to identify unnecessary code and whether its recommendations are relevant in practice. Unnecessary code can but does not need to be dead code. So, technically we are not focussing on a reachability analysis but use heuristics to identify unnecessary code. The paper presents a strong evaluation of the approach, for which a study on 14 open-source and closed-source software systems is conducted. As there is no perfect oracle for unnecessary code, we compared recommendations for unnecessary code with historical cleanups, runtime usage data, and feedback from 25 developers of five software projects. Our study shows that recommendations generated from stability and centrality information point to unnecessary code that cannot be identified by dead code detectors. Developers confirmed that 34% of recommendations were indeed unnecessary and deleted 20% of the recommendations shortly after our interviews. Overall, our results suggest that static analysis can provide quick feedback on unnecessary code and is useful in practice."

      "Abstract": "Statistical language modeling techniques have successfully been applied to large source code corpora, yielding a variety of new software development tools, such as tools for code suggestion, improving readability, and API migration. A major issue with these techniques is that code introduces new vocabulary at a far higher rate than natural language, as new identifier names proliferate. Both large vocabularies and out-of-vocabulary issues severely affect Neural Language Models (NLMs) of source code, degrading their performance and rendering them unable to scale. In this paper, we address this issue by: 1) studying how various modelling choices impact the resulting vocabulary on a large-scale corpus of 13,362 projects; 2) presenting an open vocabulary source code NLM that can scale to such a corpus, 100 times larger than in previous work; and 3) showing that such models outperform the state of the art on three distinct code corpora (Java, C, Python). To our knowledge, these are the largest NLMs for code that have been reported. All datasets, code, and trained models used in this work are publicly available."

      "Abstract": "With an increasing number of value-flow properties to check, existing static program analysis still tends to have scalability issues when high precision is required. We observe that the key design flaw behind the scalability problem is that the core static analysis engine is unaware of the properties being checked and, thus, inevitably loses the opportunities to exploit the mutual synergies among different properties. Our approach is inter-property-aware and able to capture possible overlaps and inconsistencies among the properties to check. Thus, before analyzing a program, we can make an optimization plan which decides how to reuse the specific analysis results of a property to speed up checking other properties. Such a synergistic interaction among the properties significantly improves the analysis performance. \nWe have evaluated our approach by checking twenty value-flow properties in standard benchmark programs and ten real-world software systems. The results demonstrate that our approach is more than 8$\\times$ faster than existing ones but consumes only 1/7 memory. Such a substantial improvement in analysis efficiency is not achieved by sacrificing effectiveness: at the time of writing, 39 bugs found by our approach have been fixed by developers and four of them have been assigned CVE IDs due to their security impact."

      "Abstract": "Alert is a kind of key data source in monitoring system for online service systems, which is used to record the anomalies in service components and report to engineers. In general, the occurrence of a service failure tends to be along with a large number of alerts, which is called alert storm. However, alert storm brings great challenges to diagnose the failure, because it is time-consuming and tedious for engineers to investigate such an overwhelming number of alerts manually. To help understand alert storm in practice, we conduct the first empirical study of alert storm based on large-scale real-world alert data and gain some valuable insights. Based on the findings obtained from the study, we propose a novel approach to handling alert storm. Specifically, this approach includes alert storm detection which aims to identify alert storm accurately, and alert storm summary which aims to recommend a small set of representative alerts to engineers for failure diagnosis. Our experimental study on real-world dataset demonstrates that our alert storm detection can achieve high F1-score (larger than 0.9). Besides, our alert storm summary can reduce the number of alerts that need to be examined by more than 98% and discover representative alerts accurately. We have successfully applied our approach to the service maintenance of a large commercial bank (China EverBright Bank), and we also share our success stories and lessons learned in industry."

      "Abstract": "Integer overflows have threatened software applications for decades. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel technique to provide automatic repairs of integer overflows in C source code. Our technique, based on static symbolic execution, fuses detection, repair generation and validation. This technique is implemented in a prototype named IntRepair. We applied IntRepair to 2,052 C programs (approx. 1 million lines of code) contained in SAMATE’s Juliet test suite and 50 synthesized programs that range up to 20KLOC. Our experimental results show that IntRepair is able to effectively detect integer overflows and successfully repair them, while only increasing the source code (LOC) and binary (Kb) size by around 1%, respectively. Further, we present the results of a user study with 30 participants which shows that IntRepair repairs are more than 10x efficient as compared to manually generated code repairs."

      "Abstract": "Continuous integration (CI) is a widely used practice in modern software engineering. Unfortunately, it is also an expensive practice — Google and Mozilla estimate their CI systems in millions of dollars. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for reducing the cost of CI. The cost of CI lies in the computing power to run builds and its value mostly lies on letting developers find bugs early — when their size is still small. Thus, we target reducing the number of builds that CI executes by still executing as many failing builds as early as possible. To achieve this goal, we propose SmartBuildSkip, a technique which predicts the first builds in a sequence of build failures and the remaining build failures separately. SmartBuildSkip is customizable, allowing developers to select different preferred trade-offs of saving many builds vs. observing build failures early. We evaluate the motivating hypothesis of SmartBuildSkip, its prediction power, and its cost savings in a realistic scenario. In its most conservative configuration, SmartBuildSkip saved a median 30% of builds by only incurring a median delay of 1 build in a median of 15% failing builds."

They do so by learning from their experience to improve their performance. RTCA DO-178C specifies a stringent certification process for airborne software which represents several challenges when applied to an ALA in regards of functional completeness, functional correctness, testability and adaptability. This research claims that it is possible to certify an Adaptive Learning Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Agent designed as per a Cognitive Architecture with current DO-178C certification process when leveraging a qualified tool (DO-330), Model-Based Development and Verification (DO-331) and Formal Methods (DO-333). The research consists in developing, as a case study, an ALA embedded in a UAV aimed at neutralizing rogue UAVs in the vicinity of civil airports and test it in the field. This article is the plan to complete, by end 2022, a dissertation currently in its confirmation phase."

      "Abstract": "Back in 2001, IBM released a manifesto pointing to the rising complexity of managing computing systems that resulted from the progressing integration of system components and the continuously changing operating conditions systems faced. Around the same time, researchers in the US and Europe raised the issue that existing software engineering approaches were not retaining the full plasticity that was required to accommodate resource variability, changing user needs, and handling system faults, without requiring downtime. A consensus grew that the only viable option to tackle the problems was to enable systems managing themselves, which are usually called self-adaptive systems. Over the past two decades, communities of different fields have put extensive efforts in understanding the principles of self-adaptation and devising novel techniques and methods to engineer self-adaptive systems. We start this talk with motivating why self-adaptation is important and we explain the basic principles that underlie a self-adaptive system. Then we zoom in on how self-adaptive systems are engineered through seven waves that emerged over time. These waves put complementary aspects of engineering self-adaptive systems in focus that synergistically have contributed to the current body of knowledge in the field. We use a practical Internet-of-Things application as an illustrative case throughout the talk. To conclude, we peak into the future of the field and propose a number of open research challenges for the years to come."

      "Abstract": "Just-In-Time Software Defect Prediction (JIT-SDP) is concerned with predicting whether software changes are defect-inducing or clean based on machine learning classifiers. Building such classifiers requires a sufficient amount of training data that is not available at the beginning of a software project. Cross-Project (CP) JIT-SDP can overcome this issue by using data from other projects to build the classifier, achieving similar (not better) predictive performance to classifiers trained on Within-Project (WP) data. However, such approaches have never been investigated in realistic online learning scenarios, where WP software changes arrive continuously over time and can be used to update the classifiers. It is unknown to what extent CP data can be helpful in such situation. In particular, it is unknown whether CP data are only useful during the very initial phase of the project when there is little WP data, or whether they could be helpful for extended periods of time. This work thus provides the first investigation of when and to what extent CP data are useful for JIT-SDP in a realistic online learning scenario. For that, we develop three different CP JIT-SDP approaches that can operate in online mode. We also collect 2048 commits from three ongoing projects being developed by a software company over the course of 9 to 10 months, and use 19,8468 commits from 10 active open source GitHub projects being developed over the course of 6 to 14 years. The study shows that CP data can lead to improvements in G-mean of up to 53.90% compared to WP classifiers at the initial stage of the projects. For the open source projects, which have been running for longer periods of time, the CP data also helped the classifiers to reduce or prevent large drops in predictive performance that may occur over time, obtaining up to around 40% better G-Mean during such periods. CP data was shown to be beneficial even after a large number of WP data were received, leading to overall G-means up to 18.5% better than those of WP classifiers."

      "Abstract": "Intermittent test failures (test flakiness) is common during continuous integration as modern software systems have become inherently non-deterministic. Understanding the root cause of test flakiness is crucial as intermittent test failures might be the result of real non-deterministic defects in the production code, rather than mere errors in the test code. Existing techniques for root causing test flakiness compare the runtime behaviour of passing and failing executions of the same test. They achieve this by repetitively executing a flaky test on an instrumented version of the system under test. This approach has two fundamental limitations: (i) code instrumentation might disrupt the normal behaviour of the test preventing the manifestation of test flakiness; (ii) passively re-executing a test many times could be insufficient for triggering intermittent test outcomes when test flakiness is rare or difficult to manifest. To address these limitations, we propose a new approach for root causing test flakiness that actively explores the non-deterministic space, without instrumenting code. Our novel idea is to repetitively execute a flaky test, under different execution clusters. Each cluster explores a certain non-deterministic dimension (e.g., concurrency, I/O, and networking) with dedicated software containers and fuzzy-driven resource load generators. The execution cluster that manifests the most balanced (or unbalanced) sets of passing and failing executions is likely to explain the broad type of test flakiness."

      "Abstract": "Automated web testing techniques infer models from a given web app, which are used for test generation. From a testing viewpoint, such an inferred model should contain the minimal set of states that are distinct, yet, adequately cover the app’s main functionalities. In practice, models inferred automatically are affected by near-duplicates, i.e., replicas of the same functional webpage differing only by small insignificant changes. We present the first study of near-duplicate detection algorithms used in within app model inference. We first characterize functional near-duplicates by classifying a random sample of state-pairs, from 493k pairs of webpages obtained from over 6,000 websites, into three categories, namely clone, near-duplicate, and distinct. We systematically compute thresholds that define the boundaries of these categories for each detection technique. We then use these thresholds to evaluate 10 near-duplicate detection techniques from three different domains, namely, information retrieval, web testing, and computer vision on nine open-source web apps. Our study highlights the challenges posed in automatically inferring a model for any given web app. Our findings show that even with the best thresholds, no algorithm is able to accurately detect all functional near-duplicates within apps, without sacrificing coverage."

      "Abstract": "Community smells have been defined as sub-optimal organizational structures that may lead to social debt. Previous studies have shown that they are highly diffused in both open- and closed-source projects, are perceived as harmful by practitioners, and can even lead to the introduction of technical debt in source code. Despite the presence of this body of research, little is known on the practitioners’ perceived prominence of community smells in practice as well as on the strategies adopted to deal with them. This paper aims at bridging this gap by proposing an empirical study in which 76 software practitioners are inquired on (i) the prominence of four well-known community smells, i.e., Organizational Silo, Black Cloud, Lone Wolf, and Radio Silence, in their contexts and (ii) the methods they adopted to “refactor” them. Our results first reveal that community smells frequently manifest themselves in software projects and, more importantly, there exist specific refactoring practices to deal with each of the considered community smells."

A taxonomy of IaC defects can be useful for understanding the nature of defects, and identifying activities needed to fix and prevent defects in IaC scripts. The goal of this paper is to help practitioners improve the quality of infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts by developing a defect taxonomy for IaC scripts through qualitative analysis. We develop a taxonomy of IaC defects by applying qualitative analysis on 1,448 defect-related commits collected from open source software (OSS) repositories of the Openstack organization. We conduct a survey with 66 practitioners to assess if they agree with the identified defect categories included in our taxonomy. We quantify the frequency of identified defect categories by analyzing 80,425 commits collected from 291 OSS repositories spanning across 2005 to 2019. \nOur defect taxonomy for IaC consists of eight categories, including a category specific to IaC called idempotency (i.e., defects that lead to incorrect system provisioning when the same IaC script is executed multiple times). We observe the surveyed 66 practitioners to agree most with idempotency. The most frequent defect category is configuration data i.e., providing erroneous configuration data in IaC scripts. Our taxonomy and the quantified frequency of the defect categories can help practitioners to improve IaC script quality by prioritizing verification and validation efforts."

      "Abstract": "Technical question and answer (Q\u0026amp;A) websites provide a platform for developers to communicate with each other by asking and answering questions. Stack Overflow is the most prominent of such websites. With the rapidly increasing number of questions on Stack Overflow, it is becoming difficult to get an answer to all questions and as a result, millions of questions on Stack Overflow remain unsolved. In an attempt to improve the visibility of unsolved questions, Stack Overflow introduced a bounty system to motivate users to solve such questions. In this bounty system, users can offer reputation points in an effort to encourage users to answer their questions. \nIn this paper, we study 129,202 bounty questions that were proposed by 61,824 bounty backers. We observe that bounty questions have a higher solving-likelihood than non-bounty questions. This is particularly true for long-standing unsolved questions. For example, questions that were unsolved for 100 days for which a bounty is proposed are more likely to be solved (55%) than those without bounties (1.7%). \nIn addition, we studied the factors that are important for the solving-likelihood and solving-time of a bounty question. We found that: (1) Questions are likely to attract more traffic after receiving a bounty than non-bounty questions. (2) Bounties work particularly well in very large communities with a relatively low question solving-likelihood. (3) High-valued bounties are associated with a higher solving-likelihood, but we did not observe a likelihood for expedited solutions. \nOur study shows that while bounties are not a silver bullet for getting a question solved, they are associated with a higher solving-likelihood of a question in most cases. As questions that are still unsolved after two days hardly receive any traffic, we recommend that Stack Overflow users propose a bounty as soon as possible after those two days for the bounty to have the highest impact."

      "Abstract": "Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated astonishing performance in many applications, there are still concerns on their dependability. One desirable property of DNN for applications with societal impact is fairness (i.e., non-discrimination). In this work, we propose a scalable approach for searching individual discriminatory instances of DNN. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach only employs lightweight procedures like gradient computation and clustering, which makes it significantly more scalable than existing methods. Experimental results show that our approach explores the search space more effectively (9 times) and generates much more individual discriminatory instances (25 times) using much less time (half to 1/7)."

Such tools can improve the speed and accuracy of software development, yet developers frequently eschew automation in favor of manual refactoring. The prevalence and difficulty of refactorings in software development indicate that automated tools have a high potential for impact. Developers report distrust and unpredictable tools as motivations for disuse, but there are no comprehensive explanations of the terms, nor guidelines for how to improve tools. My hypothesis is that developers will find refactoring tools more useful the automation aligns with how they plan and execute manual code changes. Through a lab study of refactoring disuse in software evolution tasks, I use observations and interview data to ground ambiguous reasons for disuse in code changes. With background in these findings, I attempt to decompose refactorings like Inline Method and Move Method into operations that are more aligned with developers’ workflow and evaluate the result by manually replicating mined refactorings, and repeating the user study using my prototype implementation."

      "Abstract": "Black-box testing has been extensively applied to test models of Cyber-Physical systems (CPS) since these models are not often amenable to static and symbolic testing and verification. Black-box testing, however, requires to execute the model under test for a large number of candidate test inputs. This poses a challenge for a large and practically-important category of CPS models, known as compute-intensive CPS (CI-CPS) models, where a single simulation may take hours to complete. We propose a novel approach, namely ARIsTEO, to enable effective and efficient testing of CI-CPS models. Our approach embeds black-box testing into an iterative approximation-refinement loop. At the start, some sampled inputs and outputs of the CI-CPS model under test are used to generate a surrogate model that is faster to execute and can be subjected to black-box testing. Any failure-revealing test identified for the surrogate model is checked on the original model. If spurious, the test results are used to refine the surrogate model to be tested again. Otherwise, the test reveals a valid failure. We evaluated ARIsTEO by comparing it with S-Taliro, an open-source and industry-strength tool for testing CPS models. Our results, obtained based on five publicly-available CPS models, show that, on average, ARIsTEO is able to find 24% more requirements violations than S-Taliro and is 31% faster than S-Taliro in finding those violations. We further assessed the effectiveness and efficiency of ARIsTEO on a large industrial case study from the satellite domain. In contrast to S-Taliro, ARIsTEO successfully tested two different versions of this model and could identify three requirements violations, requiring four hours, on average, for each violation."

Existing certification processes, however, suffer from a lack of rigor and automation, and often incur a significant amount of manual effort on both system developers and certifiers. To address this issue, we propose a substantially automated, cost-effective certification method, backed with a novel \\emph{analysis synthesis} technique to automatically generate application-specific analysis tools that are custom-tailored to producing the necessary evidence. The outcome of this research promises to not only assist software developers in producing safer and more reliable software, but also benefit industrial certification agencies by significantly reducing the manual effort of certifiers. Early validation flows from experience applying this approach in constructing an assurance case for a surgical robot system in collaboration with the Center for the Advanced Surgical Technology."

      "Abstract": "App stores include a vast amount of user feedback in the form of app ratings and reviews. Research and recently also tool vendors have proposed data mining and data analytics solutions to leverage this feedback to developers and analysts, e.g., for extracting requirements-related information, monitoring the opinions of users on apps’ features, or informing release decisions. Research also showed that positive feedback improves apps’ downloads and sales figures and is thus fundamental to the success of apps. \nAs a side effect, a market for fake, incentivized app reviews emerged with yet unclear consequences for developers, app users, and app store operators. Fake reviews are prohibited in popular app stores, such as in Google Play or Apple App Store. Even governmental competition authorities started taking actions against companies using fake reviews to embellish their apps. For instance, the Canadian telecommunication provider Bell was fined $1.25 million for faking positive reviews to their apps. \nOur journal-first paper reports on a study of fake reviews, their providers, characteristics, and how accurately they can be automatically detected. (1) We identified and conducted disguised questionnaires with 43 fake review providers and studied their review policies to understand their strategies and offers. We found that developers buy reviews to relatively expensive prices of a few dollars or deal with reviews in exchange portals (i.e., “I will write a positive review to your app if you do the same for my app”). The questionnaires and policies revealed that fake reviews are written to look authentic and are hard to recognize by humans. (2) By identifying and comparing 60,000 fake reviews with 62 million reviews from the Apple App Store, we found significant differences, e.g., between the corresponding apps, reviewers, rating distribution, and frequency. (3) This inspired the development of a simple classifier to automatically detect potential fake reviews in app stores. Based on the identified differences between fake and regular reviews, we developed, trained, fine-tuned, and compared multiple supervised machine learning approaches. (4) To have a more realistic setting of how our classifier can perform in practice, we conducted an in-the-wild experiment by varying the skewness of our dataset. On a labelled and imbalanced dataset, including one-tenth of fake reviews, as reported in other domains, our classifier achieved a recall of 91% and an AUC/ROC value of 98%. \nWe publicly share our gold-standard fake reviews dataset to enable the development of more accurate classifiers for identifying fake reviews or fake reviews candidates. \nWe discuss our findings and their impact on software engineering, app users, and app store operators. Although information extracted from app reviews is getting increasingly integrated into the requirements engineering process, none of the previous works in the research area app store analysis have considered fake reviews and their implications. By applying an existing app store analysis approach, we showed that requirements-related feedback, in the form of bug reports and feature requests, is included in both fake and regular reviews. Ignoring fake reviews might lead to wrong assumptions about actual user needs. Not optimal decisions for future development might be drawn too. Moreover, fake reviews might damage the integrity of app stores. Recently, Google highlighted the negative effects of fake reviews in an official statement and explicitly asked developers not to buy, and users not to provide fake reviews."

      "Abstract": "In modern software development, software libraries play a crucial role in reducing software development effort and improving software quality. However, at the same time, the asynchronous upgrades of software libraries and client software projects often result in incompatibilities between different versions of libraries and client projects. When libraries evolve, it is often very challenging for library developers to maintain the so-called backward compatibility and keep all their external behavior untouched, and behavioral backward incompatibilities (BBIs) may occur. In practice, the regression test suites of library projects often fail to detect all BBIs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose DeBBI to detect BBIs via cross-project testing and analysis, i.e., using the test suites of various client projects to detect library BBIs. Since executing all the possible client projects can be extremely time consuming, DeBBI transforms the problem of cross-project BBI detection into a traditional information retrieval (IR) problem to execute the client projects with higher probability to detect BBIs earlier. Furthermore, DeBBI considers project diversity and test relevance information for even faster BBI detection. The experimental results show that DeBBI can reduce the end-to-end testing time for detecting the first and average unique BBIs by 99.1% and 70.8% for JDK compared to naive cross-project BBI detection. Also, DeBBI has been applied to other popular 3rd-party libraries, and detected 19 BBI bugs (with 3 already confirmed as previously unknown bugs)."

      "Abstract": "Generating high-quality system call sequences is not only important to testing file system implementations, but also challenging due to the astronomically large input space. This paper introduces a new methodology for generating workloads for testing modern complex software, namely, the layered model checking, which generates diverse abstract workloads with respect to abstract models and extends them to concrete ones layer by layer. The methodology is instantiated as a file system workload generator. In a short-period experiment run, sequential workloads (system call sequences) manifested over a thousand crashes in mainline Linux Kernel file systems, with 12 previously unknown bugs being reported. We also provide evidence that such workloads benefit other domain-specific testing techniques including crash consistency testing and concurrency testing."

      "Abstract": "Once a programmer knows one language, they can leverage concepts and knowledge already learned, and easily pick up another programming language. But is that always the case? To understand if programmers have difficulty learning additional programming languages, we conducted an empirical study of Stack Overflow questions across 18 different programming languages. We hypothesized that previous knowledge could potentially interfere with learning a new programming language. From our inspection of 450 Stack Overflow questions, we found 276 instances of interference that occurred due to faulty assumptions originating from knowledge about a different language. To understand why these difficulties occurred, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 professional programmers. The interviews revealed that programmers make failed attempts to relate a new programming language with what they already know. Our findings inform design implications for technical authors, toolsmiths, and language designers, such as designing documentation and automated tools that reduce interference, anticipating uncommon language transitions during language design, and welcoming programmers not just into a language, but its entire ecosystem."

      "Abstract": "Software engineering in the industrial automation domain requires generic methods to keep the development complexity at an acceptable level. However, nowadays various PLC vendors use different dialects of the standardized programming languages in their tools, which hinders the re-usability and interoperability across the platforms. The service-oriented approaches can serve to overcome interoperability issues. In distributed control systems, the functionality of an automation component can be offered to the other parties that constitute a production system via a standardized interface, easing the orchestration of the whole system. This paper proposes such a generic interface that hides away the low-level implementation of a particular functionality and provides a common semantic model for the execution. Further, it is shown how such an interface can be used to support and automate the overall engineering process, combining the functionality of different components to fulfill a production task. The reference implementation of the proposed concept was used in an industrial demonstrator, which shows the benefits in the overall system flexibility due to components interoperability and re-usability compared to the traditional control approaches."

      "Abstract": "Patching is a common activity in software development. It is generally performed on a source code base to address bugs or add new functionalities. In this context, given the recurrence of bugs across projects, the associated similar patches can be leveraged to extract generic fix actions. While the literature includes various approaches leveraging similarity among patches to guide program repair, these approaches often do not yield fix patterns that are tractable and reusable as actionable input to APR systems. In this paper, we propose a systematic and automated approach to mining relevant and actionable fix patterns based on an iterative clustering strategy applied to atomic changes within patches. The goal of FixMiner is thus to infer separate and reusable fix patterns that can be leveraged in other patch generation systems. Our technique, FixMiner, leverages Rich Edit Script which is a specialized tree structure of the edit scripts that captures the ASTlevel context of the code changes. FixMiner uses different tree representations of Rich Edit Scripts for each round of clustering to identify similar changes. These are abstract syntax trees, edit actions trees, and code context trees. We have evaluated FixMiner on thousands of software patches collected from open source projects. Preliminary results show that we are able to mine accurate patterns, efficiently exploiting change information in Rich Edit Scripts. We further integrated the mined patterns to an automated program repair prototype, PARFixMiner, with which we are able to correctly fix 26 bugs of the Defects4J benchmark. Beyond this quantitative performance, we show that the mined fix patterns are sufficiently relevant to produce patches with a high probability of correctness: 81% of PARFixMiner’s generated plausible patches are correct."

      "Abstract": "Identifying and optimizing open participation is essential to the success of open software development. Existing studies highlighted the importance of worker recommendation for crowdtesting tasks in order to detect more bugs with fewer workers. However, these studies mainly provide one-time recommendations, i.e., recommending a set of workers for a new task with its fixed, initial context at the beginning of the task. We argue the need for in-process crowdtesting worker recommendation. We motivate this study through a pilot study, revealing the prevalence of long-sized non-yielding windows, i.e., no new bugs are revealed in consecutive test reports during the process of a crowdtesting task. This indicates the potential opportunity for accelerating test cycle by recommending appropriateworkers in a dynamic manner, so that the non-yielding windows could be shortened. This paper proposes a context-aware in-process crowdworker recommendation approach, R3Rec, to dynamically identify and rank a diverse set of capable crowdworkers, in order to detect more bugs earlier and potentially shorten the non-yielding windows. It consists of three main components: 1) the modeling of dynamic testing context in terms of process context and resource context to capture the in-process progress and worker characteristics respectively; 2) the learning-based ranking component to learn the probability of crowdworkers’ bug detection capability; and 3) the diversity-based re-ranking component to adjust the ranked list to potentially reduce the duplicate bugs. The evaluation is conducted on 636 crowdtesting tasks from one of the largest crowdtesting platforms, and the results showthat R3Rec can shorten the non-yielding windows by 50% -58% and reduce the total crowdtesting cost by about 10% on median. This is the first work to propose the in-process worker recommendation solution, and results showed its potential in improving the costeffectiveness of crowdtesting by saving the cost and shortening the testing cycle."

      "Abstract": "Developers usually depend on inserting logging statements into the source code to collect system runtime information. Such logged information is valuable for software maintenance. A logging statement usually prints one or more variables to record vital system status. However, due to the lack of rigorous logging guidance and the requirement of domain-specific knowledge, it is not easy for developers to make proper decisions about which variables to log. To address this need, in this paper [1], we propose an approach to recommend logging variables for developers during development by learning from existing logging statements. Different from other prediction tasks in software engineering, this task has two challenges: 1) Dynamic labels – different logging statements have different sets of accessible variables, which means in this task, the set of possible labels of each sample is not the same. 2) Out-of-vocabulary words – identifiers’ names are not limited to natural language words and the test set usually contains a number of program tokens which are out of the vocabulary built from the training set and cannot be appropriately mapped to word embeddings. To deal with the first challenge, we convert this task into a representation learning problem instead of a multi-label classification problem. Given a code snippet which lacks a logging statement, our approach first leverages a neural network with an RNN (recurrent neural network) layer and a self-attention layer to learn the proper representation of each program token, and then predicts whether each token should be logged through a unified binary classifier based on the learned representation. To handle the second challenge, we propose a novel method to map program tokens into word embeddings by making use of the pre-trained word embeddings of natural language tokens. We evaluate our approach on 9 large and high-quality Java projects. Our evaluation results show that the average MAP of our approach is over 0.84, outperforming random guess and an information-retrieval-based method by large margins."

      "Abstract": "When identifying the origin of software bugs, many studies assume that \"a bug was introduced by the lines of code that were modified to fix it\u0027\u0027. However, this assumption does not always hold and at least in some cases, these modified lines are not responsible for introducing the bug. For example, when the bug was caused by a change in an external API. The lack of empirical evidence makes it impossible to assess how important these cases are and therefore, to which extent the assumption is valid. \nTo advance in this direction, and better understand how bugs \"are born\u0027\u0027, we propose a model for defining criteria to identify the first snapshot of an evolving software system that exhibits a bug. This model, based on the \\emph{perfect test} idea, decides whether a bug is observed after a change to the software. Furthermore, we studied the model’s criteria by carefully analyzing how 116 bugs were introduced in two different open source software projects. The manual analysis helped classify the root cause of those bugs and created manually curated datasets with bug-introducing changes and with bugs that were not introduced by any change in the source code. Finally, we used these datasets to evaluate the performance of four existing SZZ-based algorithms for detecting bug-introducing changes. We found that SZZ-based algorithms are not very accurate, especially when multiple commits are found; the F-Score varies from 0.44 to 0.77, while the percentage of true positives does not exceed 63%. \nOur results show empirical evidence that the prevalent assumption, \"a bug was introduced by the lines of code that were modified to fix it\u0027\u0027, is just one case of how bugs are introduced in a software system. Finding what introduced a bug is not trivial: bugs can be introduced by the developers and be in the code, or be created irrespective of the code. Thus, further research towards a better understanding of the origin of bugs in software projects could help to improve design integration tests and to design other procedures to make software development more robust."

      "Abstract": "Deep learning has gained tremendous traction from the developer and researcher communities. It plays an increasingly significant role in a number of application domains. Deep learning frameworks are proposed to help developers and researchers easily leverage deep learning technologies, and they attract a great number of discussions on popular platforms, i.e., Stack Overflow and GitHub. To understand and compare the insights from these two platforms, we mine the topics of interests from these two platforms. Specifically, we apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling techniques to derive the discussion topics related to three popular deep learning frameworks, namely, Tensorflow, PyTorch and Theano. Within each platform, we compare the topics across the three deep learning frameworks. Moreover, we make a comparison of topics between the two platforms. Our observations include 1) a wide range of topics that are discussed about the three deep learning frameworks on both platforms, and the most popular workflow stages are Model Training and Preliminary Preparation. 2) the topic distributions at the workflow level and topic category level on Tensorflow and PyTorch are always similar while the topic distribution pattern on Theano is quite different. In addition, the topic trends at the workflow level and topic category level of the three deep learning frameworks are quite different. 3) the topics at the workflow level show different trends across the two platforms. e.g., the trend of the Preliminary Preparation stage topic on Stack Overflow comes to be relatively stable after 2016, while the trend of it on GitHub shows a stronger upward trend after 2016. Besides, the Model Training stage topic still achieves the highest impact scores across two platforms. Based on the findings, we also discuss implications for practitioners and researchers."

      "Abstract": "Deep learning has made significant achievements in many application areas. To train and test models more efficiently, enterprise developers submit and run their deep learning programs on a shared, multi-tenant platform. However, some of them fail after a long execution time due to code/script defects, which reduces the development productivity and wastes expensive hardware resources like GPU and network I/O. \nThis paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study on program failures of deep learning jobs. 4960 real failures are collected from Platform-H of Company-X. We manually examine their failure messages and classify them into 20 categories. In addition, we identify the common root causes and bug-fix solutions on a sample of 400 failures. To better understand the current testing and debugging practices for deep learning, we also conduct developer interviews. Our major findings include: (1) 48.0% of the failures occur in interaction with the platform rather than in the execution of code logic, mostly due to the discrepancies between local and platform execution environments; (2) Deep learning specific failures (13.5%) are mainly caused by inappropriate model parameters/structures and framework API misunderstanding; (3) Current debugging practices are not efficient for fault localization in many cases, so developers need more deep learning specific tools. Based on our findings, we further suggest possible research topics and tooling support that could facilitate future deep learning development."

      "Abstract": "While CUDA has become a mainstream parallel computing plat\u0002form and programming model for general-purpose GPU computing, how to effectively and efficiently detect CUDA synchronization bugs remains a challenging open problem. In this paper, we es\u0002tablish the first lightweight CUDA synchronization bug detection framework, namely Simulee, to model CUDA program execution by interpreting the corresponding LLVM bytecode and collecting the memory-access information for automatically detecting gen\u0002eral CUDA synchronization bugs. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of Simulee, we construct a benchmark with 7 popular CUDA-related projects from GitHub, upon which we conduct an extensive set of experiments. The experimental results suggest that Simulee can detect 21 out of the 24 manually identified bugs in our preliminary study and also 24 previously unknown bugs among all projects, 10 of which have already been confirmed by the develop\u0002ers. Furthermore, Simulee significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for CUDA synchronization bug detection."

      "Abstract": "Modern, agile software development methods rely on iterative work and improvement cycles to deliver their claimed benefits. In Scrum, the most popular agile method, process improvement is implemented through regular Retrospective meetings. In these meetings, team members reflect on the latest development iteration and decide on improvement actions. To identify potential issues, data on the completed iteration needs to be gathered. The Scrum method itself does not prescribe these steps in detail. However, Retrospective games, i.e. interactive group activities, have been proposed to encourage the sharing of experiences and problems. These activities mostly rely on the collected perceptions of team members. However, modern software development practices produce a large variety of digital project artifacts, e.g. commits in version control systems or test run results, which contain detailed information on performed teamwork. We propose taking advantage of this information in new, data-driven Retrospective activities, allowing teams to gain additional insights based on their own team-specific data."

      "Abstract": "In this paper, we present SAVER, a new memory-error repair technique for C programs. Memory errors such as memory leak, double-free, and use-after-free are highly prevalent and fixing them requires significant effort from developers. Automated program repair techniques hold the promise of reducing this burden but the state-of-the-art is still unsatisfactory. In particular, no existing techniques are able to fix those errors in a scalable, precise, and safe way, all of which are required for a truly practical tool. SAVER~aims to address these shortcomings of existing techniques. To this end, we propose an approach based on a novel representation of the program called object flow graph, which summarizes the program’s heap-related behavior using static analysis. We show that fixing memory errors can be formulated as a graph labeling problem over this graph and present an efficient algorithm to solve it. We evaluated SAVER~in combination with an industrial-strength static bug-finder and show that 75% of the reported errors can be fixed automatically by SAVER~for a range of open-source C programs."

      "Abstract": "Mobile robots are increasingly used in complex environments, often for accomplishing tasks by end-users with no knowledge or expertise in mathematics, computer science, or robotics. Providing techniques that support robotic software development is a major software engineering challenge. One of the most prominent software engineering problems in the robotic domain is the definition of the mission the robotic software must accomplish and the translation of this mission into a form that enables automated reasoning. On one hand, missions should be defined with a notation that is sufficiently high-level and user-friendly. On the other hand, to enable automated reasoning, the notation should be unambiguous and provide a formal and precise description of what robots should do in terms of movements and actions. Software engineers typically express robotic missions in natural language (mission requirements) and subsequently translate them into more precise mission specifications. The latter are often expressed in domain-specific languages or temporal logics. Defining robotic missions is generally challenging – as widely recognized in both the software engineering and robotics communities – since mission requirements are often ambiguous, hindering precise and unambiguous specification. \nTo support engineers in the definition of mission requirements and specifications we proposed a new set of patterns focusing on robot movement, as well as on how robots perform actions within their environment [4]. The set of patterns, in the form of a catalog, has been produced by analyzing 245 natural-language mission requirements systematically retrieved from robotics literature. From these requirements, we identified recurrent mission specification problems and conceived template solutions, organized as patterns. Our patterns provide a vocabulary that supports engineers in defining mission requirements and validated mission specifications for recurrent mission requirements. The usage of our patterns is supported by a tool, namely PsALM (Pattern bAsed Mission specifier [2]), that allows (i) specifying a mission requirement through a structured English grammar, and (ii)~automatically generating specifications from mission requirements. Our patterns and tool are available online [1]. \nWe checked the presence of errors in proposed patterns by testing the patterns on a set of 12 randomly generated models representing buildings where a robot is deployed. We considered ten mission requirements (each obtained by combining different patterns), converted the mission requirements into mission specifications and used those to generate robots’ plans. We used a simulator to verify that the plans satisfied the intended mission requirement. We subsequently generated two specifications for each mission requirement obtained by considering different target specification languages. We verified the correspondence among the proposed specifications. \nWe evaluated the benefits of using our patterns for designing missions. We collected 441 mission requirements in natural language: 436 obtained from robotic development environments used by practitioners, and five defined in collaboration with two well-known robotics companies developing commercial, human-size service robots (BOSCH and PAL Robotics). We showed that most of the mission requirements were ambiguous but expressible using the proposed patterns, and that the usage of our patterns reduces ambiguities. We then evaluated the coverage of mission specifications. We collected 1251 mission specifications from robotic development environments used by practitioners and research publications and show that almost all specifications can be obtained using the proposed patterns (1154 over $251, i.e., ≈ 92%). We also generated specifications for five mission requirements defined in collaboration with the two robotics partners and fed them into an existing planner. The produced plans were correctly executed by real robots, demonstrating the benefits of patterns’ support in real scenarios. Videos are available on our website [1]. \nA small fragment of this work has been published as an extended abstract [3] and a tool-demo paper [2] where we presented the initial idea and a description of our toolset for early dissemination. Our following paper [4] presents our work in full extent, explaining the methodology, all patterns along with their formalization, as well as evaluation of the patterns’ correctness and benefit using real-world mission requirements and mission specifications. \n[1] 2018.

      "Abstract": "In-app advertisements have become an integral part of the revenue model of mobile apps. To gain ad revenue, app developers integrate ad libraries into their apps. Such libraries are integrated to serve advertisements (ads) to users; developers then gain revenue based on the displayed ads and the users’ interactions with such ads. As a result, ad libraries have become an essential part of the mobile app ecosystem. However, little is known about how such ad libraries have evolved over time. \nIn this paper, we study the evolution of the 8 most popular ad libraries (e.g., Google AdMob and Facebook Audience Network) over a period of 33 months (from April 2016 until December 2018). In particular, we look at their evolution in terms of size, the main drivers for releasing a new version, and their architecture. To identify popular ad libraries, we collect 35,462 updates of 1,840 top free-to-download apps in the Google Play Store. Then, we identify 63 ad libraries that are integrated into the studied popular apps. We observe that an ad library represents 10% of the binary size of mobile apps, and that the proportion of the ad library size compared to the app size has grown by 10% over our study period. By taking a closer look at the 8 most popular ad libraries, we find that ad libraries are continuously evolving with a median release interval of 34 days. In addition, we observe that some libraries have grown exponentially in size (e.g, Facebook Audience Network), while other libraries have attempted to reduce their size as they evolved. The libraries that reduced their size have done so through: (1) creating a lighter version of the ad library, (2) removing parts of the ad library, and (3) redesigning their architecture into a more modular one. To identify the main drivers for releasing a new version, we manually analyze the release notes of the eight studied ad libraries. We observe that fixing issues that are related to displaying video ads is the main driver for releasing new versions. We also observe that ad library developers are constantly updating their libraries to support a wider range of Android platforms (i.e., to ensure that more devices can use the libraries without errors). Finally, we derive a reference architecture from the studied eight ad libraries, and we study how these libraries deviated from this architecture in the study period. \nOur study is important for ad library developers as it provides the first in-depth look into how the important mobile app market segment of ad libraries has evolved. Our findings and the reference architecture are valuable for ad library developers who wish to learn about how other developers built and evolved their successful ad libraries. For example, our reference architecture provides a new ad library developer with a foundation for understanding the interactions between the most important components of an ad library."

      "Abstract": "Failure to account for human values in software (e.g., equality and fairness) can result in user dissatisfaction and negative socio-economic impact. Engineering these values in software, however, requires technical and methodological support throughout the development life cycle. This paper investigates to what extent top Software Engineering (SE) conferences and journals have included research on human values in SE. We investigate the prevalence of human values in recent (2015 - 2018) publications in these top venues. We classify these publications, based on their relevance to different values, against a widely used value structure adopted from the social sciences. Our results show that: (a) only a small proportion of the publications directly consider values, classified as directly relevant publications; (b) for the majority of the values, very few or no directly relevant publications were found; and (c) the prevalence of directly relevant publications was higher in SE conferences compared to SE journals. This paper shares these and other insights that may motivate future research on human values in software engineering."

We conducted a case study of 26 final year software engineering students and collected the perceptions of individual contributions to team efforts through regular surveys. We report evidence of an egocentric bias in engineering team members, which decreased over time. In contrast, we found no in-group bias, i.e. favoritism regarding contributions of own team members.We discuss our initial analyses and results, which can be explained by group cohesiveness as well as non-competition and group similarity, respectively."

Adaptive random testing (ART) aims to enhance RT’s failure-detection ability by more evenly spreading the test cases over the input domain. Since its introduction in 2001, there have been many contributions to the development of ART, including various approaches, implementations, assessment and evaluation methods, and applications.

Typically, programming assignments are evaluated against a set of test-inputs. This checks for output equivalence, but limited to the cases that have been tested for. One may compose the programs sequentially and assert at the end that the outputs must match. But verifying such programs is not easy; the proofs often require that the functionality of every component program be captured fully, making invariant inference a challenge. One may discover mismatches (i.e., bugs) using a bounded model checker, but their absence brings us back to the question of verification. In this paper, we show how a hypersafety verification technique can effectively be used for verifying correctness of programming assignments. This connects two seemingly unrelated problems, and opens up the possibility of employing tools and techniques being developed for the former to efficiently address the latter. We demonstrate the practicability of this approach by using a hypersafety verification tool named \\emph{weaver} and several sample assignment problems."

      "Abstract": "Research has established the wide variety of security failures in mobile apps, their consequences, and how app developers introduce or exacerbate them. What is not well known is why developers do so—what is the rationale underpinning the decisions they make which eventually strengthen or weaken app security? This is all the more complicated in modern app development’s increasingly diverse demographic: growing numbers of independent, solo, or small team developers who do not have the organizational structures and support that larger software development houses enjoy. \nThrough two studies, we open the box on developer rationale, by performing a holistic analysis of the rationale underpinning various activities in which app developers engage when developing an app. \nThe first study does so through a task-based study with app developers (N\u003d44) incorporating six distinct tasks for which this developer demographic must take responsibility: setting up a development environment, reviewing code, seeking help, seeking testers, selecting an advertisement SDK, and software licensing. We found that, while on first glance in several activities participants seemed to prioritize security, only in the code task such prioritization was underpinned by a security rationale—indicating that development behavior perceived to be secure may only be an illusion until the box is opened on their rationale. \nThe second study confirms these findings through a wider survey of app developers (N\u003d274) investigating to what extent they find the activities of the task-based study to affect their app’s security. In line with the task-based study, we found that developers perceived actively writing code and actively using external SDKs as the only security-relevant, while similarly disregarding other activities having an impact on app security. \nOur results suggest the need for a stronger focus on the tasks and activities surrounding the coding task—all of which need to be underpinned by a security rationale. Without such a holistic focus, developers may write “secure code” but not produce “secure apps”."

      "Abstract": "The notion of forking has changed with the rise of distributed version control systems and social coding environments, like GitHub. Traditionally forking refers to splitting off an independent development branch (which we call hard forks); research on hard forks, conducted mostly in pre-GitHub days showed that hard forks were often seen critical as they may fragment a community. Today, in social forking environments, open-source developers are encouraged to fork a project in order to integrate contributions to the community (which we call social forks), which may have also influenced perceptions and practices around hard forks. To revisit hard forks, we identify, study and classify 15,306 hard forks on GitHub and interview 18 owners of hard forks or forked repositories. We find that, among others, hard forks often evolve out of social forks rather than being planned deliberately and that perception about hard forks have indeed changed dramatically, seeing them often as a positive non-competitive alternative to the original project."

      "Abstract": "Mutation testing can be used to assess the fault-detection capabilities of a given test suite. To this aim, two characteristics of mutation testing frameworks are of paramount importance: (i) they should generate mutants that are representative of real faults; and (ii) they should provide a complete tool chain able to automatically generate, inject, and test the mutants. To address the first point, we recently proposed an approach using a Recurrent Neural Network EncoderDecoder architecture to learn mutants from ∼787k faults mined from real programs. The empirical evaluation of this approach confirmed its ability to generate mutants representative of real faults. In this paper, we address the second point, presenting DeepMutation, a tool wrapping our deep learning model into a fully automated tool chain able to generate, inject, and test mutants learned from real faults.

      "Abstract": "Continuous Integration (CI) has been claimed to introduce several benefits in software development, including high software quality and reliability. However, recent work pointed out challenges, barriers and bad practices characterizing its adoption. This paper empirically investigates what are the bad practices experienced by developers applying CI. The investigation has been conducted by leveraging semi-structured interviews of 13 experts and mining more than 2,300 Stack Overflow posts. As a result, we compiled a catalog of 79 CI bad smells belonging to 7 categories related to different dimensions of a CI pipeline management and process. We have also investigated the perceived importance of the identified bad smells through a survey involving 26 professional developers and discussed how the results of our study relate to existing knowledge about CI bad practices. Whilst some results, such as the poor usage of branches, confirm existing literature, the study also highlights uncovered bad practices, e.g., related to static analysis tools or the abuse of shell scripts, and contradict knowledge from existing literature, e.g., about avoiding nightly builds. We discuss the implications of our catalog of CI bad smells for (i) practitioners, e.g., favor specific, portable tools over hacking, and do not ignore nor hide build failures, (ii) educators, e.g., teach CI culture, not just technology, and teach CI by providing examples of what not to do, and (iii) researchers, e.g., developing support for failure analysis, as well as automated CI bad smell detectors."

For much of its existence, software engineering has not had to deal directly with safety. Software is an abstraction and abstractions do not directly harm anyone or anything: it does not explode, catch on fire, or exude toxins. It can, of course, indirectly cause harm by providing unsafe control over physical processes that are directly dangerous. But until relatively recently, software was used to control dangerous physical processes only in limited and constrained circumstances. That genie has been let out of the bottle and nearly every dangerous system is now controlled by software. In this presentation, I will describe what needs to be done to limit the damage done by software and the new practices that are required to deal with the problem. \nBio. Dr. Nancy Leveson has worked in the field of system safety for 30 years. Currently she is Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics and also Professor of Engineering Systems at MIT. She is an elected member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and has received many awards such as the ACM Allen Newell Award for outstanding computer science research, the AIAA Information Systems Award for “developing the field of software safety and for promoting responsible software and system engineering practices where life and property are at stake,” and the ACM Sigsoft Outstanding Research Award. She has published over 200 research papers and is author of a book, Safeware: System Safety and Computers, published by Addison-Wesley and recently translated into Japanese and a new book Engineering a Safer World published by MIT Press in January 2012. \nPeter O’Hearn \n From Program Semantics to Software Engineering, and back. \nBio. Peter O’Hearn is a Research Scientist at Facebook and a Professor at University College London. Peter has done research in the broad areas of programming languages and logic for over 25 years, having held academic positions at Syracuse University, Queen Mary University of London, and University College London, before joining Facebook in 2013 with the acquisition of his verification startup Monoidics. With John Reynolds Peter devised separation logic, a theory which opened up new practical possibilities for program proof, including the technology which led to the Infer program analyzer developed by Peter’s team at Facebook. Infer runs internally on Facebook’s code bases, detecting over 100,000 bugs which have been fixed by Facebook’s developers in the past five years. Infer is also used in production at number of other companies, including Amazon, Mozilla, Spotify and Marks and Spencer. Peter is a Fellow of the Royal Society, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and he has received a number of awards for his work including the the 2016 Godel Prize, the 2016 CAV Award and the 2011 and 2019 POPL MIP Awards. Peter received an honorary doctorate from Dalhousie University in 2018. \nChan-Mo Park \n ICT Manpower Development and Software Technology in the DPRK. The government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, also referred to by many as “North Korea”) realized the importance of Information and Computing Technology (ICT) and began to establish a master plan for ICT adoption after Kim Il Sung toured eight countries in Eastern Europe in 1984. Kim determined that electronics-related high technology was key to national economic development, and technical cooperation contracts were signed with many of the countries he visited. Moreover, DPRK students were sent to those countries to learn modern technologies. In 1988, a three-year plan for the promotion of science and technology began, and the government began to provide massive funding for information science and industry. In addition, through the International Cooperation Bureau of the State Commission of Science and Technology, the DPRK has been seeking help from UN organizations such as the United Nations Development Program and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. Also, the DPRK signed an MoU with the International Institute for Software Technology of United Nations University on a joint effort for software development. The DPRK has been stressing software sectors more than hardware sectors due to its poor economic situation and various restrictions (such as those imposed by the Wassenaar Agreement, COCOM, and EAR) on the importation of advanced equipment. The software industry does not require a large amount of capital but instead requires good human brains and creativity. In general, young people in the DPRK are very strong in mathematics and basic sciences. In this presentation, the general education system in the DPRK will be briefly described, and this will be followed by a detailed discussion of several aspects of ICT education in the DPRK, including education in secondary schools for gifted students, the establishment of computer technology universities, and ICT education at prestigious universities and research institutions including KISU(Kim Il Sung University), KUT(Kim-Chaek University of Technology), PUST(Pyongyang University of Science and Technology), KCC(Korea Computer Center) and PIC(Pyongyang Informatics Center). The level of software technology in the DPRK is nearly on a par with that of Western countries. The Silver Star Go game developed in 1997 won the first prize in the global computer Go game competition held in Japan in 1998. Since then, the DPRK has won first prize several years in a row. The DPRK government initiated many programs to encourage and improve the DPRK’s software capability. Some of the software products developed in earlier days will be presented, together with those displayed at the DPRK Computer Software Seminar being held in Beijing, China in April, 2002. After the historic meeting of Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong Il in June 2000, inter-Korean collaborations in ICT, in particular those involving technology, had become quite active until the South Korean government halted collaborations on May 24, 2010. Some examples of inter-Korean projects will be described. Finally, a brief introduction to Pyongyang University of Science and Technology and its role in nurturing skilled graduates with global mindsets, in order to lead the DPRK into the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution, will be presented. \nBio. Dr. Chan-Mo Park was the 4th President of Pohang University of Science \u0026amp; Technology (POSTECH). After retiring from POSTECH in 2007 Prof. Park served as a Special Advisor on S \u0026amp; T to the President of Republic of Korea (ROK) before he assumed a Chancellor position with Pyongyang University of Science \u0026amp; Technology (PUST), a unique private and international university in DPRK since October, 2010. Prof. Park received his B.S. degree from Seoul National University and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from University of Maryland, College Park. He earned an Honorary Doctor of Letters degree from the University of Maryland University College in 2001 in recognition of his scholarly achievements and distinguished service. Dr. Park’s experience includes professorships in Computer Science both in U.S.A. and Korea. His research interests are Computer Graphics, Virtual Reality, System Simulation and Science Diplomacy. For the past several years, he has been involved with research activities concerning IT development in DPRK including a joint research with Pyongyang Informatics Centre (PIC) for 7 years. Dr. Park was decorated by ROK with the National Order of Camellia in 1986 for his contributions to the advancement of S \u0026amp; T in Korea and received the Teacher of the Year Award from The Catholic University of America in 1987. In June, 2005 he was decorated by ROK with the Blue Stripes Order of Service Merit for his contributions on IT development in Korea and collaborations with DPRK. Prof. Park also received the International Alumnus Award from the University of Maryland, College Park in April, 2009 for providing significant leadership to another country’s educational, cultural, social and economic development. In November, 2018 Chancellor Park received the Dosan Education Award from Dosan Academy in Seoul, Korea for his contribution to the Advancement of Science and Technology in Korea, Manpower development and Inter-Korean Collaboration on Information Technology.  \n   Most Influential Paper from ICSE N-10   \n \nWe are pleased to announce this year’s this year’s recipient of the ICSE 2020 Most Influential Paper Award from ICSE 2010: \n \n Oracle-Guided Component-Based Program Synthesis Susmit Jha, Sumit Gulwani, Sanjit A. Seshia, Ashish Tiwari https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id\u003d1806833 \n \n“By bringing together the notion of an oracle providing input/output examples with the reduction of synthesis to two kinds of search problems — those aiming at producing oracle-consistent programs and those producing distinguishing inputs to further elaborate the candidate program — ‘Oracle-guided component-based program synthesis’ has made a significant impact in Software Engineering and beyond, inspiring subsequent work not only on program synthesis and learning, but also on automated program repair, controller synthesis, and interpretable artificial intelligence.” – Sebastian Uchitel, co-Chair, MIP Committee \nA Decade of Oracle-Guided Program Synthesis: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities \nProgram Synthesis is concerned with the fascinating goal of generating a program to meet a specification that can be given in one of many forms. The field has evolved over the years, but it is in the last decade that it has truly exploded with new techniques and applications. In this talk, we place our paper from ICSE 2010, titled “Oracle-guided component-based synthesis” in this journey of program synthesis. We describe the results in the paper, and their impact on some key trends in modern program synthesis, namely counterexample-guided inductive synthesis, programming by examples, and domain-specific languages for synthesis, as well as theoretical and practical connections with machine learning. We highlight follow-up work on synthesis partly influenced by this paper from academia and across industries ranging from software and hardware to logistics and aerospace. We identify successes, failures, and the key challenges remaining to the broader deployment of automated synthesis techniques. We hope our experience will inspire researchers and students pursuing the goal of automated synthesis. \nBios:  Susmit Jha is a Principal Computer Scientist at SRI International, leading the research on building trustworthy, resilient, and interpretable neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence.

Seshia, Ashish Tiwari https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id\u003d1806833 \n \n“By bringing together the notion of an oracle providing input/output examples with the reduction of synthesis to two kinds of search problems — those aiming at producing oracle-consistent programs and those producing distinguishing inputs to further elaborate the candidate program — ‘Oracle-guided component-based program synthesis’ has made a significant impact in Software Engineering and beyond, inspiring subsequent work not only on program synthesis and learning, but also on automated program repair, controller synthesis, and interpretable artificial intelligence.” – Sebastian Uchitel, co-Chair, MIP Committee \nA Decade of Oracle-Guided Program Synthesis: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities \nProgram Synthesis is concerned with the fascinating goal of generating a program to meet a specification that can be given in one of many forms. The field has evolved over the years, but it is in the last decade that it has truly exploded with new techniques and applications. In this talk, we place our paper from ICSE 2010, titled “Oracle-guided component-based synthesis” in this journey of program synthesis. We describe the results in the paper, and their impact on some key trends in modern program synthesis, namely counterexample-guided inductive synthesis, programming by examples, and domain-specific languages for synthesis, as well as theoretical and practical connections with machine learning. We highlight follow-up work on synthesis partly influenced by this paper from academia and across industries ranging from software and hardware to logistics and aerospace. We identify successes, failures, and the key challenges remaining to the broader deployment of automated synthesis techniques. We hope our experience will inspire researchers and students pursuing the goal of automated synthesis. \nBios:  Susmit Jha is a Principal Computer Scientist at SRI International, leading the research on building trustworthy, resilient, and interpretable neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence.

For much of its existence, software engineering has not had to deal directly with safety. Software is an abstraction and abstractions do not directly harm anyone or anything: it does not explode, catch on fire, or exude toxins. It can, of course, indirectly cause harm by providing unsafe control over physical processes that are directly dangerous. But until relatively recently, software was used to control dangerous physical processes only in limited and constrained circumstances. That genie has been let out of the bottle and nearly every dangerous system is now controlled by software. In this presentation, I will describe what needs to be done to limit the damage done by software and the new practices that are required to deal with the problem. \nBio. Dr. Nancy Leveson has worked in the field of system safety for 30 years. Currently she is Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics and also Professor of Engineering Systems at MIT. She is an elected member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and has received many awards such as the ACM Allen Newell Award for outstanding computer science research, the AIAA Information Systems Award for “developing the field of software safety and for promoting responsible software and system engineering practices where life and property are at stake,” and the ACM Sigsoft Outstanding Research Award. She has published over 200 research papers and is author of a book, Safeware: System Safety and Computers, published by Addison-Wesley and recently translated into Japanese and a new book Engineering a Safer World published by MIT Press in January 2012. \nPeter O’Hearn \n From Program Semantics to Software Engineering, and back. \nBio. Peter O’Hearn is a Research Scientist at Facebook and a Professor at University College London. Peter has done research in the broad areas of programming languages and logic for over 25 years, having held academic positions at Syracuse University, Queen Mary University of London, and University College London, before joining Facebook in 2013 with the acquisition of his verification startup Monoidics. With John Reynolds Peter devised separation logic, a theory which opened up new practical possibilities for program proof, including the technology which led to the Infer program analyzer developed by Peter’s team at Facebook. Infer runs internally on Facebook’s code bases, detecting over 100,000 bugs which have been fixed by Facebook’s developers in the past five years. Infer is also used in production at number of other companies, including Amazon, Mozilla, Spotify and Marks and Spencer. Peter is a Fellow of the Royal Society, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and he has received a number of awards for his work including the the 2016 Godel Prize, the 2016 CAV Award and the 2011 and 2019 POPL MIP Awards. Peter received an honorary doctorate from Dalhousie University in 2018. \nChan-Mo Park \n ICT Manpower Development and Software Technology in the DPRK. The government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, also referred to by many as “North Korea”) realized the importance of Information and Computing Technology (ICT) and began to establish a master plan for ICT adoption after Kim Il Sung toured eight countries in Eastern Europe in 1984. Kim determined that electronics-related high technology was key to national economic development, and technical cooperation contracts were signed with many of the countries he visited. Moreover, DPRK students were sent to those countries to learn modern technologies. In 1988, a three-year plan for the promotion of science and technology began, and the government began to provide massive funding for information science and industry. In addition, through the International Cooperation Bureau of the State Commission of Science and Technology, the DPRK has been seeking help from UN organizations such as the United Nations Development Program and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. Also, the DPRK signed an MoU with the International Institute for Software Technology of United Nations University on a joint effort for software development. The DPRK has been stressing software sectors more than hardware sectors due to its poor economic situation and various restrictions (such as those imposed by the Wassenaar Agreement, COCOM, and EAR) on the importation of advanced equipment. The software industry does not require a large amount of capital but instead requires good human brains and creativity. In general, young people in the DPRK are very strong in mathematics and basic sciences. In this presentation, the general education system in the DPRK will be briefly described, and this will be followed by a detailed discussion of several aspects of ICT education in the DPRK, including education in secondary schools for gifted students, the establishment of computer technology universities, and ICT education at prestigious universities and research institutions including KISU(Kim Il Sung University), KUT(Kim-Chaek University of Technology), PUST(Pyongyang University of Science and Technology), KCC(Korea Computer Center) and PIC(Pyongyang Informatics Center). The level of software technology in the DPRK is nearly on a par with that of Western countries. The Silver Star Go game developed in 1997 won the first prize in the global computer Go game competition held in Japan in 1998. Since then, the DPRK has won first prize several years in a row. The DPRK government initiated many programs to encourage and improve the DPRK’s software capability. Some of the software products developed in earlier days will be presented, together with those displayed at the DPRK Computer Software Seminar being held in Beijing, China in April, 2002. After the historic meeting of Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong Il in June 2000, inter-Korean collaborations in ICT, in particular those involving technology, had become quite active until the South Korean government halted collaborations on May 24, 2010. Some examples of inter-Korean projects will be described. Finally, a brief introduction to Pyongyang University of Science and Technology and its role in nurturing skilled graduates with global mindsets, in order to lead the DPRK into the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution, will be presented. \nBio. Dr. Chan-Mo Park was the 4th President of Pohang University of Science \u0026amp; Technology (POSTECH). After retiring from POSTECH in 2007 Prof. Park served as a Special Advisor on S \u0026amp; T to the President of Republic of Korea (ROK) before he assumed a Chancellor position with Pyongyang University of Science \u0026amp; Technology (PUST), a unique private and international university in DPRK since October, 2010. Prof. Park received his B.S. degree from Seoul National University and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from University of Maryland, College Park. He earned an Honorary Doctor of Letters degree from the University of Maryland University College in 2001 in recognition of his scholarly achievements and distinguished service. Dr. Park’s experience includes professorships in Computer Science both in U.S.A. and Korea. His research interests are Computer Graphics, Virtual Reality, System Simulation and Science Diplomacy. For the past several years, he has been involved with research activities concerning IT development in DPRK including a joint research with Pyongyang Informatics Centre (PIC) for 7 years. Dr. Park was decorated by ROK with the National Order of Camellia in 1986 for his contributions to the advancement of S \u0026amp; T in Korea and received the Teacher of the Year Award from The Catholic University of America in 1987. In June, 2005 he was decorated by ROK with the Blue Stripes Order of Service Merit for his contributions on IT development in Korea and collaborations with DPRK. Prof. Park also received the International Alumnus Award from the University of Maryland, College Park in April, 2009 for providing significant leadership to another country’s educational, cultural, social and economic development. In November, 2018 Chancellor Park received the Dosan Education Award from Dosan Academy in Seoul, Korea for his contribution to the Advancement of Science and Technology in Korea, Manpower development and Inter-Korean Collaboration on Information Technology.  \n   Most Influential Paper from ICSE N-10   \n \nWe are pleased to announce this year’s this year’s recipient of the ICSE 2020 Most Influential Paper Award from ICSE 2010: \n \n Oracle-Guided Component-Based Program Synthesis Susmit Jha, Sumit Gulwani, Sanjit A.

In addition, through the International Cooperation Bureau of the State Commission of Science and Technology, the DPRK has been seeking help from UN organizations such as the United Nations Development Program and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. Also, the DPRK signed an MoU with the International Institute for Software Technology of United Nations University on a joint effort for software development. The DPRK has been stressing software sectors more than hardware sectors due to its poor economic situation and various restrictions (such as those imposed by the Wassenaar Agreement, COCOM, and EAR) on the importation of advanced equipment. The software industry does not require a large amount of capital but instead requires good human brains and creativity. In general, young people in the DPRK are very strong in mathematics and basic sciences. In this presentation, the general education system in the DPRK will be briefly described, and this will be followed by a detailed discussion of several aspects of ICT education in the DPRK, including education in secondary schools for gifted students, the establishment of computer technology universities, and ICT education at prestigious universities and research institutions including KISU(Kim Il Sung University), KUT(Kim-Chaek University of Technology), PUST(Pyongyang University of Science and Technology), KCC(Korea Computer Center) and PIC(Pyongyang Informatics Center). The level of software technology in the DPRK is nearly on a par with that of Western countries. The Silver Star Go game developed in 1997 won the first prize in the global computer Go game competition held in Japan in 1998. Since then, the DPRK has won first prize several years in a row. The DPRK government initiated many programs to encourage and improve the DPRK’s software capability. Some of the software products developed in earlier days will be presented, together with those displayed at the DPRK Computer Software Seminar being held in Beijing, China in April, 2002. After the historic meeting of Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong Il in June 2000, inter-Korean collaborations in ICT, in particular those involving technology, had become quite active until the South Korean government halted collaborations on May 24, 2010. Some examples of inter-Korean projects will be described. Finally, a brief introduction to Pyongyang University of Science and Technology and its role in nurturing skilled graduates with global mindsets, in order to lead the DPRK into the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution, will be presented. \nBio.

Seshia, Ashish Tiwari https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id\u003d1806833 \n \n“By bringing together the notion of an oracle providing input/output examples with the reduction of synthesis to two kinds of search problems — those aiming at producing oracle-consistent programs and those producing distinguishing inputs to further elaborate the candidate program — ‘Oracle-guided component-based program synthesis’ has made a significant impact in Software Engineering and beyond, inspiring subsequent work not only on program synthesis and learning, but also on automated program repair, controller synthesis, and interpretable artificial intelligence.” – Sebastian Uchitel, co-Chair, MIP Committee \nA Decade of Oracle-Guided Program Synthesis: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities \nProgram Synthesis is concerned with the fascinating goal of generating a program to meet a specification that can be given in one of many forms. The field has evolved over the years, but it is in the last decade that it has truly exploded with new techniques and applications. In this talk, we place our paper from ICSE 2010, titled “Oracle-guided component-based synthesis” in this journey of program synthesis. We describe the results in the paper, and their impact on some key trends in modern program synthesis, namely counterexample-guided inductive synthesis, programming by examples, and domain-specific languages for synthesis, as well as theoretical and practical connections with machine learning. We highlight follow-up work on synthesis partly influenced by this paper from academia and across industries ranging from software and hardware to logistics and aerospace. We identify successes, failures, and the key challenges remaining to the broader deployment of automated synthesis techniques. We hope our experience will inspire researchers and students pursuing the goal of automated synthesis. \nBios:  Susmit Jha is a Principal Computer Scientist at SRI International, leading the research on building trustworthy, resilient, and interpretable neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence.

Around the same time, researchers in the US and Europe raised the issue that existing software engineering approaches were not retaining the full plasticity that was required to accommodate resource variability, changing user needs, and handling system faults, without requiring downtime. A consensus grew that the only viable option to tackle the problems was to enable systems managing themselves, which are usually called self-adaptive systems. Over the past two decades, communities of different fields have put extensive efforts in understanding the principles of self-adaptation and devising novel techniques and methods to engineer self-adaptive systems. We start this talk with motivating why self-adaptation is important and we explain the basic principles that underlie a self-adaptive system. Then we zoom in on how self-adaptive systems are engineered through seven waves that emerged over time. These waves put complementary aspects of engineering self-adaptive systems in focus that synergistically have contributed to the current body of knowledge in the field. We use a practical Internet-of-Things application as an illustrative case throughout the talk. To conclude, we peak into the future of the field and propose a number of open research challenges for the years to come. \nShort bio  \n\n \n \n   \n      \n    Danny Weyns is a professor at the Department of Computer Science of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium, where he is a member of the imec-DistriNet research group.

As software development gradually shifts to the development of data analytics with AI and ML technologies, existing software engineering techniques must be re-imagined to provide the productivity gains that developers desire. We conducted a large scale study of almost 800 professional data scientists in software industry to investigate what a data scientist is, what data scientists do, and what challenges they face. This study has found that ensuring correctness is a huge problem in data analytics. Software developers currently do not have a good method for increasing confidence on the quality of data analytics development. We argue for re-targeting software engineering tools and research directions to address new challenges in the era of data-centric software development. We showcase a few examples of software engineering techniques that re-invent automated debugging and testing for data analytics. In particular, we discuss interactive debugging primitives, automated debugging, data provenance, and symbolic-execution based test generation for big data analytics in Apache Spark. We conclude with open problems in software engineering to support data-centric software development and the needs of AI and ML workforce. \n \n\n \n \n   \n      \n    Miryung Kim is a Full Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles.

In the research community, software automation has been a decades-long dream, where software developers are freed from tedious programming tasks for constructing the initial version of software, and from expensive software maintenance tasks for evolving the software to future versions in order to catch up with the changes from requirements or execution environments. Example software automation technologies include program synthesis, code completion, program transformation, code recommendation, program repair, and software self-evolution. In the past decade, software development, maintenance, and deployment produce a huge volume of software engineering data such as source code, version histories, feature specifications, bug reports, test cases, execution traces/logs, and real-world user feedback. These data supply a valuable source of inputs for software automation technologies. These data supplies provide great potential to substantially boost these technologies’ effectiveness and efficiency toward realizing software automation in not only academic settings but also industrial settings. This technical briefing discusses recent research and future directions in data-driven software automation, as an important objective in the increasingly popular fields of software analytics and intelligent software engineering. \nShort bios:  \n \n \n   \n      \n    Tao Xie is a Chair Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Peking University, China.

This study has found that ensuring correctness is a huge problem in data analytics. Software developers currently do not have a good method for increasing confidence on the quality of data analytics development. We argue for re-targeting software engineering tools and research directions to address new challenges in the era of data-centric software development. We showcase a few examples of software engineering techniques that re-invent automated debugging and testing for data analytics. In particular, we discuss interactive debugging primitives, automated debugging, data provenance, and symbolic-execution based test generation for big data analytics in Apache Spark. We conclude with open problems in software engineering to support data-centric software development and the needs of AI and ML workforce. \n \n\n \n \n   \n      \n    Miryung Kim is a Full Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles.

In the research community, software automation has been a decades-long dream, where software developers are freed from tedious programming tasks for constructing the initial version of software, and from expensive software maintenance tasks for evolving the software to future versions in order to catch up with the changes from requirements or execution environments. Example software automation technologies include program synthesis, code completion, program transformation, code recommendation, program repair, and software self-evolution. In the past decade, software development, maintenance, and deployment produce a huge volume of software engineering data such as source code, version histories, feature specifications, bug reports, test cases, execution traces/logs, and real-world user feedback. These data supply a valuable source of inputs for software automation technologies. These data supplies provide great potential to substantially boost these technologies’ effectiveness and efficiency toward realizing software automation in not only academic settings but also industrial settings. This technical briefing discusses recent research and future directions in data-driven software automation, as an important objective in the increasingly popular fields of software analytics and intelligent software engineering. \nShort bios:  \n \n \n   \n      \n    Tao Xie is a Chair Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Peking University, China.

Businesses rely on ads to find their customers. Publishers and creators rely on digital advertising as their source of revenue. Finally ads enable end users to reach internet content for free. In this talk, I will provide a high-level overview of the Google ads system. The talk will focus on different machine learning systems that power Google ads: the challenges these models face, the scale at which they operate, how they evolve, and some of the state-of-the-art techniques they leverage. I will highlight how these models classify internet content, how they decide when and what ads to show, how they help advertisers reach the right audience, and how they help us protect users. \n \n\n \n \n   \n      \n    Marija Mikic is a Software Engineering Director at Google Los Angeles and site lead for Google Los Angeles, where she has been employed since 2004.

In this talk I will provide an overview of some mobile robotic platforms and frameworks that we have targeted to ground our research efforts in addressing these challenges, the range of properties that those systems are meant to satisfy from robustness to ethical concerns, and the body of techniques we have developed to address those challenges that span from type analysis to oracle analysis, and from DNN verification to trajectory and environment generation. \n \n\n \n \n   \n      \n    Sebastian Elbaum is a Professor of Computer Science and Anita Jones Fellow at the University of Virginia.

Around the same time, researchers in the US and Europe raised the issue that existing software engineering approaches were not retaining the full plasticity that was required to accommodate resource variability, changing user needs, and handling system faults, without requiring downtime. A consensus grew that the only viable option to tackle the problems was to enable systems managing themselves, which are usually called self-adaptive systems. Over the past two decades, communities of different fields have put extensive efforts in understanding the principles of self-adaptation and devising novel techniques and methods to engineer self-adaptive systems. We start this talk with motivating why self-adaptation is important and we explain the basic principles that underlie a self-adaptive system. Then we zoom in on how self-adaptive systems are engineered through seven waves that emerged over time. These waves put complementary aspects of engineering self-adaptive systems in focus that synergistically have contributed to the current body of knowledge in the field. We use a practical Internet-of-Things application as an illustrative case throughout the talk. To conclude, we peak into the future of the field and propose a number of open research challenges for the years to come. \nShort bio  \n\n \n \n   \n      \n    Danny Weyns is a professor at the Department of Computer Science of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium, where he is a member of the imec-DistriNet research group.

      "Abstract": "ICSE 2020 Technical Briefings offer conference attendees the opportunity to gain new insight, knowledge, and skills in select software engineering areas of topical importance today. Each technical briefing is led by an expert in the relevant field, and typically consists of an overview of the problem, a description of current and emerging practical approaches and relevant research results, and a brief outlook at possible future trends and research directions. Technical briefings will be 90 minutes in length each and aimed at both industrial participants and academic participants. Technical briefings will be integrated into the main conference program. \nICSE 2020 Technical Briefings \nMachine Learning in Google Ads Marija Mikic Google, USA \nProgram Analysis Meets Autonomous Robots Sebastian Elbaum University of Virginia, USA \nSelf-Adaptive Systems: Why, What, and How to Engineer Them?

Businesses rely on ads to find their customers. Publishers and creators rely on digital advertising as their source of revenue. Finally ads enable end users to reach internet content for free. In this talk, I will provide a high-level overview of the Google ads system. The talk will focus on different machine learning systems that power Google ads: the challenges these models face, the scale at which they operate, how they evolve, and some of the state-of-the-art techniques they leverage. I will highlight how these models classify internet content, how they decide when and what ads to show, how they help advertisers reach the right audience, and how they help us protect users. \n \n\n \n \n   \n      \n    Marija Mikic is a Software Engineering Director at Google Los Angeles and site lead for Google Los Angeles, where she has been employed since 2004.

In turn, these faults highlight the limitations of existing program analysis techniques, which are being challenged not just by the immense input space, but also by the integration of cyber and physical semantics, the multiple sources of uncertainty, and the incorporation of machine learning components. In this talk I will provide an overview of some mobile robotic platforms and frameworks that we have targeted to ground our research efforts in addressing these challenges, the range of properties that those systems are meant to satisfy from robustness to ethical concerns, and the body of techniques we have developed to address those challenges that span from type analysis to oracle analysis, and from DNN verification to trajectory and environment generation. \n \n\n \n \n   \n      \n    Sebastian Elbaum is a Professor of Computer Science and Anita Jones Fellow at the University of Virginia. His research aims to build dependable systems through domain-specific analysis techniques. His current efforts are focused on robotic systems. He is the recipient of an NSF Career Award, an IBM Innovation Award, a Google Faculty Research Award, an FSE Test of Time Award 2018, and several ACM SigSoft Distinguished Paper Awards, mostly for empirically studying program analysis and software testing challenges, and developing automated techniques for addressing them.

Around the same time, researchers in the US and Europe raised the issue that existing software engineering approaches were not retaining the full plasticity that was required to accommodate resource variability, changing user needs, and handling system faults, without requiring downtime. A consensus grew that the only viable option to tackle the problems was to enable systems managing themselves, which are usually called self-adaptive systems. Over the past two decades, communities of different fields have put extensive efforts in understanding the principles of self-adaptation and devising novel techniques and methods to engineer self-adaptive systems. We start this talk with motivating why self-adaptation is important and we explain the basic principles that underlie a self-adaptive system. Then we zoom in on how self-adaptive systems are engineered through seven waves that emerged over time. These waves put complementary aspects of engineering self-adaptive systems in focus that synergistically have contributed to the current body of knowledge in the field. We use a practical Internet-of-Things application as an illustrative case throughout the talk. To conclude, we peak into the future of the field and propose a number of open research challenges for the years to come. \nShort bio  \n\n \n \n   \n      \n    Danny Weyns is a professor at the Department of Computer Science of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium, where he is a member of the imec-DistriNet research group. He is also part time affiliated with Linnaeus University Sweden. Dr. Weyns’ main research interests are in software engineering of self-adaptive systems. With his team of PhD students, he studies the use of formal techniques and design models during operation to realize and assure self-adaptation for different quality goals. His team has a particular interest in decentralized systems, where adaptation needs to be realized by multiple feedback loops. Recently, the team started investigating the use of online learning techniques to support self-adaptation in large-scale systems that are exposed to complex types of uncertainties. Currently, he leads the research project “Trustworthy Decentralized Self-Adaptive Systems” and the project “Dependable Adaptive Software Systems for the Digital World.” Dr. Weyns recently authored the book “An Introduction to Self-adaptive Systems - A Contemporary Software Engineering Perspective.”  \n   \n \n \n \nSoftware Engineering for Data Analytics (SE4DA) \nMiryung Kim University of California, Los Angeles, USA \nWe are at an inflection point where software engineering meets the data-centric world of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. As software development gradually shifts to the development of data analytics with AI and ML technologies, existing software engineering techniques must be re-imagined to provide the productivity gains that developers desire. We conducted a large scale study of almost 800 professional data scientists in software industry to investigate what a data scientist is, what data scientists do, and what challenges they face. This study has found that ensuring correctness is a huge problem in data analytics. Software developers currently do not have a good method for increasing confidence on the quality of data analytics development. We argue for re-targeting software engineering tools and research directions to address new challenges in the era of data-centric software development. We showcase a few examples of software engineering techniques that re-invent automated debugging and testing for data analytics. In particular, we discuss interactive debugging primitives, automated debugging, data provenance, and symbolic-execution based test generation for big data analytics in Apache Spark. We conclude with open problems in software engineering to support data-centric software development and the needs of AI and ML workforce. \n \n\n \n \n   \n      \n    Miryung Kim is a Full Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles.

In the research community, software automation has been a decades-long dream, where software developers are freed from tedious programming tasks for constructing the initial version of software, and from expensive software maintenance tasks for evolving the software to future versions in order to catch up with the changes from requirements or execution environments. Example software automation technologies include program synthesis, code completion, program transformation, code recommendation, program repair, and software self-evolution. In the past decade, software development, maintenance, and deployment produce a huge volume of software engineering data such as source code, version histories, feature specifications, bug reports, test cases, execution traces/logs, and real-world user feedback. These data supply a valuable source of inputs for software automation technologies. These data supplies provide great potential to substantially boost these technologies’ effectiveness and efficiency toward realizing software automation in not only academic settings but also industrial settings. This technical briefing discusses recent research and future directions in data-driven software automation, as an important objective in the increasingly popular fields of software analytics and intelligent software engineering. \nShort bios:  \n \n \n   \n      \n    Tao Xie is a Chair Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Peking University, China.

      "Key": "thomasreps",
      "Bio": "Thomas W. Reps is the J. Barkley Rosser Professor \u0026amp; Rajiv and Ritu Batra Chair in the Computer Sciences Department of the University of Wisconsin, which he joined in 1985. Reps is the author or co-author of four books and more than one hundred seventy-five papers describing his research (see http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~reps/). His work has concerned a wide variety of topics, including program slicing, dataflow analysis, pointer analysis, model checking, computer security, code instrumentation, language-based program-development environments, the use of program profiling in software testing, software renovation, incremental algorithms, and attribute grammars. \nHis collaboration with Professor Tim Teitelbaum at Cornell University from 1978 to 1985 led to the creation of two systems—the Cornell Program Synthesizer and the Synthesizer Generator—that explored how to build interactive programming tools that incorporate knowledge about the programming language being supported. The systems that they created were similar to modern program-development environments, such as Microsoft Visual Studio and Eclipse, but pre-dated them by more than two decades. Reps is President of GrammaTech, Inc., which he and Teitelbaum founded in 1988 to commercialize this work. \nAt Wisconsin, Professor Reps and collaborator Professor Susan Horwitz carried out many investigations of program slicing and its applications in software engineering. Reps’s most recent work concerns program analysis, computer security, and software model checking. \nIn 1996, Reps served as a consultant to DARPA to help them plan a project aimed at reducing the impact of the Year 2000 Problem on the U.S. Department of Defense. In 2003, he served on the F/A-22 Avionics Advisory Team, which provided advice to the U.S. Department of Defense about problems uncovered during integration testing of the plane’s avionics software. \nProfessor Reps received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Cornell University in 1982. His Ph.D. dissertation won the 1983 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award. \nReps’s 1988 paper on interprocedural slicing, with Susan Horwitz and his then-student David Binkley, was selected as one of the 50 most influential papers from the ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), 1979-99. According to Google Scholar, the 1988 paper and the subsequent journal version have received over 1,780 citations. \nHis 2004 paper about analysis of assembly code, with his student Gogul Balakrishnan, received the ETAPS Best-Paper Award for 2004 from the European Association for Programming Languages and Systems (EAPLS). His 2008 paper about a system for generating static analyzers for machine instructions, with his student Junghee Lim, received the ETAPS Best-Paper Award for 2008 from EAPLS. In 2010, his 1984 paper “The Synthesizer Generator,” with Tim Teitelbaum, received an ACM SIGSOFT Retrospective Impact Paper Award. In 2011, his 1994 paper “Speeding up slicing,” with Susan Horwitz, Mooly Sagiv, and Genevieve Rosay, also received an ACM SIGSOFT Retrospective Impact Paper Award. \nFour of his students, Gogul Balakrishnan, Akash Lal, Junghee Lim, and Aditya Thakur, have been recipients of the Outstanding Graduate Student Research Award given by the University of Wisconsin Computer Sciences Department. Akash Lal was also a co-recipient of the 2009 SIGPLAN Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, and he was named as one of the 18 awardees selected for the 2011 India TR-35 list (top innovators under 35). \nReps has also been the recipient of an NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award (1986), a Packard Fellowship (1988), a Humboldt Research Award (2000), and a Guggenheim Fellowship (2000). He is also an ACM Fellow (2005). In 2013, Reps was elected a foreign member of Academia Europaea. \nReps has held visiting positions at the Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique (INRIA) in Rocquencourt, France (1982-83), the University of Copenhagen, Denmark (1993-94), the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche in Pisa, Italy (2000-2001), and the University Paris Diderot—Paris 7 (2007-2008).",

Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering. She directs the Code \u0026amp; Cognition Lab, where she studies human aspects of programming. Her earliest work included techniques for automatically answering questions about program behavior to support debugging, program understanding, and reuse. Her later work studied interactions between developers and users, and techniques for web scale aggregation of user intent through help systems; she co-founded AnswerDash to commercialize these ideas. Her latest work investigates programming skills and new methods for learning them, including the programming language knowledge, APIs knowledge, and programming strategies. This work has spanned over 80 peer-reviewed publications, 11 receiving best paper awards and 4 receiving most influential paper awards. She received her Ph.D. at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in 2008, and degrees in Computer Science and Psychology with Honors from Oregon State University in 2002.",

He is an active member of the corresponding international research communities, serving in various conference organization and program committees. The University of Antwerp hosted a number of influential scientific conferences among others the 15th edition of the “Working Conference on Reverse Engineering” (WCRE) in September 2008; the 25th edition of the renowned “Automated Software Engineering Conference” (ASE) in September 2010 and (last but not least) the “Software Evolution Week” (CSMR-WCRE 2013) in February 2013. He has written a book entitled “Object-Oriented Reengineering” and edited a book on “Software Evolution”. He also authored numerous peer reviewed articles, many of them in highly respected scientific journals. He completed his M.Sc. in 1987 and his Ph.D. in 1996, both at the “Vrije Universiteit Brussel”. After his Ph.D., he worked for three years in Switzerland, where he served as a technical co-ordinator of an European research project. Switzerland remains near and dear to his heart, witness the sabbatical leave during 2009-2010 at the University of Zürich in the research group SEAL.",

He discovered firsthand the challenges of the traditional IT approaches such as Prince2. He joined ING to become a team manager for both development and operations departments. In this role he spent a lot of time closing the gap between OPS and DEV. About 12 years ago he became a LEAN six sigma black belt and started to improve the traditional IT way of working. He quickly adopted Agile Scrum, helped to implement DevOps within ING and co-founded the ING IT Academy. Today he and his team are implementing a standard IT engineering platform for ING worldwide. This platform includes a standard continuous delivery pipeline in Azure DevOps integrated with ServiceNow.",

I hold a bachelor’s degree in system engineering from Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander (2004) and postgraduate’s degree in Informatics project management from Universidad de Pamplona (2008), Colombia. I achieved a Cum Laude degree in my master at Universidad de Los Andes, with a thesis focused on enterprise architecture alignment between business process and information domain applying DSL, MDE and ontology alignment techniques. Meanwhile, I was a software architect at ICFES, a government Institution in charge of the national education assessment. At ICFES, I worked in IT projects related to national test enrollment, appointment and score publication. Additionally, I have taught in undergraduate courses of database foundations and design at Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano. In 2016, I started my Ph.D. at Universidad de Los Andes, and my research deals with how to facilitate the adoption of big data analytics solutions. My motivation emerged from the real-life enterprise challenges adopting and deploying such applications. In addition, I worked at Alianza Caoba, which is a public-private initiative to gather Colombian government, industry and scholar community around applied research on big data analytics. In 2018, I was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to continue my research through an internship at the Worldwide Computing Laboratory of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute RPI, Troy NY. Currently, I am working as a teacher at Universidad de Los Andes.",

He was a core member of the Laboratory for Reliable Software at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and taught classes on software testing at the California Institute of Technology. His activities at JPL included a role as lead developer and designer for test automation for the Mars Science Laboratory mission’s internal flight software test team, and lead roles in testing file systems for space missions. In 2009, he joined the faculty in Computer Science at Oregon State University, and was promoted to Associate Professor in 2015. In 2017, he joined the faculty of the new School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems (SICCS) at Northern Arizona University, to focus on software testing techniques for ensuring security and reliability of complex systems, especially embedded, scientific, and systems software. \nHis research interests are in software engineering, particularly testing, model checking, static analysis, automated debugging, and execution understanding. He focuses on software engineering from an “investigative” viewpoint, with an emphasis on the execution traces that programs produce — software engineering as the art and science of building programs with a desired set of executions. \nHis recent work has resulted in a DSL and (he hopes) usable and powerful testing tool for Python, the TSTL system, https://github.com/agroce/tstl, as well as contributions to the DeepState C/C++ unit testing interface to symbolic execution tools and fuzzers such as AFL and libFuzzer, https://github.com/trailofbits/deepstate.",

Prior, he was faculty member at Polytechnique Montréal and Université de Montréal, where he started as assistant professor in 2003. In 2014, he was awarded the NSERC Research Chair Tier II on Patterns in Mixed-language Systems. In 2013-2014, he visited KAIST, Yonsei U., and Seoul National University, in Korea, as well as the National Institute of Informatics, in Japan, during his sabbatical year. In 2010, he became IEEE Senior Member. In 2009, he obtained the NSERC Research Chair Tier II on Software Patterns and Patterns of Software. In 2003, he received a Ph.D. in Software Engineering from University of Nantes, France, under Professor Pierre Cointe’s supervision. His Ph.D. thesis was funded by Object Technology International, Inc. (now IBM Ottawa Labs.), where he worked in 1999 and 2000. In 1998, he graduated as engineer from École des Mines of Nantes. His research interests are program understanding and program quality, in particular through the use and the identification of recurring patterns. He was the first to use explanation-based constraint programming in the context of software engineering to identify occurrences of patterns. He is interested also in empirical software engineering; he uses eye-trackers to understand and to develop theories about program comprehension. He has published papers in international conferences and journals, including IEEE TSE, Springer EMSE, ACM/IEEE ICSE, IEEE ICSME, and IEEE SANER. He was the program co-chair and general chair of several events, including IEEE SANER’15, APSEC’14, and IEEE ICSM’13.",

I received my PhD degree from the University College London, where I was supervised by Prof. Mark Harman and Dr. Jens Krinke. My research interests tend to revolve around software and repositories analysis. I find software engineering data fascinating due to its complexity, lack of structure and mix of technical and social aspects. My recent publications involve microservices, software architecture, software refactoring, modern code review, and mining software repositores. Search based software engineering has been my introduction to academia and it is a topic I cannot keep myself away from.",

He has a Ph.D. (2008) in Informatics from Universidade Nova de Lisboa. \nThe broad aim of his research is to improve the software developer’s productivity and developer experience, in order to better deal with software development complexity. Miguel uses Evidence-Based, Empirical Software Engineering, and User Experience evaluation techniques to identify the strengths and shortcomings in languages, tools, and approaches. He uses these quantitative and qualitative assessments not only in the evaluation of Software Engineering claims but also as an objective input to help to devise improvements to fix the identified shortcomings. Miguel is particularly interested in improving the understandability of Requirements Engineering and Domain-Specific Languages (and of specifications built with those languages), to empower developers and other stakeholders to more effectively read and write software specifications. More recently, Miguel has also been working as a member of the COST Action on Multi-Paradigm Modeling for Cyber-Physical Systems. \nMiguel has published over 50 papers in peer-reviewed international journals, conferences, and workshops, and served as guest editor of special issues in international journals, as PC member, and as PC and Organizing Chair in several events. He received the best paper award at the 26th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE 2014), and was a co-author of the paper receiving the János Szentes Award for the best paper on Software Metrics presented at the 6th European Conference on Software Quality (ECSQ 1999).",

He is passionate about increasing the impact of software engineering research, which has manifested itself in his professional activities. His day job serves as a ongoing personal experiment on how to, and how not to, transfer technology. His open source work has created a tool downloaded by 47,000+ developers. His recent chairing of five industrial tracks in software engineering (e.g., ICSE, FSE, ICPC, SANER, ICSME) gave him deep insight into the challenges and successes of others’ transfer efforts. His recent project, the FlowLight, which had exposure on venues like The Wall Street Journal and BBC Radio, opened his eyes to the impact of popular publications. Finally, his position as the Co-Editor-In-Chief of the Journal of Systems and Software gives him a more permanent platform to encourage industrial publications. David’s career goal is: To be a champion of impact through service and an example of impact through projects.",

I received my PhD degree from the University College London, where I was supervised by Prof. Mark Harman and Dr. Jens Krinke. My research interests tend to revolve around software and repositories analysis. I find software engineering data fascinating due to its complexity, lack of structure and mix of technical and social aspects. My recent publications involve microservices, software architecture, software refactoring, modern code review, and mining software repositores. Search based software engineering has been my introduction to academia and it is a topic I cannot keep myself away from.",
